- text: "Now the match is really well set - and Karjakin has two whites in a row"
  date: "2016-11-19"
- text: "Karjakin seems to have wasted his two whites. Still level but now Magnus has three whites from five games - and will finish match on a white."

- text: "Turns out Karjakin didn't need his whites. Won with black after a crazy game. Must be a huge favourite now"

- text: "The [Pro Chess League](https://www.chess.com/article/view/pro-chess-league-guide) was interesting but I didn't watch it often as there was no easy way to just watch one team's games so I couldn't easily track how the Irish team were doing. Hopefully next year each time will have their own page on the site showing just their games."
