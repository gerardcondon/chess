description: My games from the second round of the Cork club ladder for the 2016-2017 season

The second round of the ladder continued and I had [white](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-ladder-2016-2017/condon-gerard-919-2.html) against one of the top rated players in the club (1800+ ICU). 
I was expecting a draw at most but instead I won!
I managed to get a passed pawn on the 6th rank and use that to attack.

The game was played with no increment due to time constraints - I was a bit nervous about this as I normally bank on using the increment for any endgame.
In this case i won just as we reached an endgame so I was ok on time.

It's a pity these games aren't rated but if I keep playing like this then my rating should move up anyway.
