I got another [win](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-championship-2017-2018/147-condon-gerard-3.html) in the club championship. 
This was a mad game - my opponent was very aggressive and I was on the defensive for the whole game.

Really I should have lost this game. 
I grabbed a couple of pawns but gave up lots of tactical opportunties. 
Luckily for me however these weren't taken but I don't think I could get away with that again.
