description: My games from the third round of the Cork club ladder for the 2016-2017 season
---

I came agonizingly close to winning my third round [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-ladder-2016-2017/793-condon-gerard-3.html) in the Cork Club Ladder. 
I had a winning position (+2.5 on the computer) at the end at move 36 and my opponent was running really short on time. 
I just needed to make one accurate move to bring out my knight instead of my bishop. 
Unfortunately I brought out the bishop first and let his rook in and lost from there.
