This was a bad day for us in the Munster League. 
We lost both our matches to Adare and Limerick B. 
The Limerick B match was especially bad as they now leapfrogged over us in the table.

I was close to getting a draw against a much higher opponent in my first [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/condon-gerard-387-11.html) but lost a crucial pawn in the endgame and went down from there. 
The second [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/440-condon-gerard-12.html) was a disaster for me. 
I got a slightly better position going into the endgame - my opponent had an isolated pawn - but then I lost a piece to a pawn fork and with it, the game.

On a more amusing note, the Munster Chess Union got a little confused as to what game we were playing. We'd probably have had a better chance in the rugby!
