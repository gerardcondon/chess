Not a great day at the Munster League. 
In my first [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2017-2018/condon-gerard-528-3.html) I got a good position and played well enough for a while. 
Then I went all in for an attack that didn't work and ended up in a losing endgame. 
I think a crucial moment was when I captured on a4 with my king. This allowed him to trap my king on the a file. 
Instead the computer suggests b3 as an alternative way to capture the pawn without getting my king trapped.

In the second [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2017-2018/577-condon-gerard-4.html) I had a repeat against my opponent from the last round last year. 
This went into the same opening but I was more prepared this time and got a much better position (technically any position would be better than horribly checkmated on the kingside). 
One interesting moment was when my opponent captured on e5. My heart sank as I thought I was either dropping a bishop or losing loads of pawns.
I said to myself that as the line losing the pawns was so bad, I may as well analyse the line that dropped the bishop. 
Then I realised that it couldn't be captured as Re8 would trap the queen.

After that I got a good position and was possibly better when my opponent offered a draw. 
Given my bad run against higher rated opponents I took the offer.

Unfortunately the B team lost both games although with Adare getting thrown out our odds of survival next year have probably improved.
