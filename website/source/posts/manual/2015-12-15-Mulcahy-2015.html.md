description: My games and analysis from the Mulcahy 2015 tournament
---

Entries for the 2016 Mulcahy tournament are open [now](http://corkchess.com/events-4/). 
The 2015 edition was the first weekend chess tournament that I played in.
I've added a page for the games along with my analysis for each game [here](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/mulcahy-2015/mulcahy-2015.html).
I didn't do too badly in this tournament.
I shared a grading prize - my second ever chess prize after my tin of Celebrations at the Cork Chess Club Xmas blitz!
