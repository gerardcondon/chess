We were back in action for rounds [3 and 4](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017.html) of the Munster League Division 1 at the weekend and Cork B had a great day out. We picked up a win and a draw in our two matches.

First up we had a draw against Adare. I managed to hold a [draw](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/543-condon-gerard-3.html) against my higher rated opponent with black which I was very happy with.

Next up we beat Sarsfields who we drew with last week. I was the beneficiary of probably a fortunate draw offer. The post mortem seemed to indicate that my opponent would probably have won the [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/755-condon-gerard-4.html). That's a win and a draw for me against Sarsfields when really I should have had two losses. If you can't be good, be lucky :)

We're in a good position now in the [table](http://www.munsterchessunion.org/league1_summary_2017.php) with 50%. And even the A team managed to get out of bed this weekend and win their games!
