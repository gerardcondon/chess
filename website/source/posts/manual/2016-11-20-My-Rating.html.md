description: Added a rating page to show my rating progress
---

I've added a [rating page](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/ratings.html) to show my rating progress (or lack of it!) over time. The first few tournaments were calculating my provisional rating so there was a great deal of variance there. Now however I have a proper rating and am making some slight progress.

The rating shown is my ICU rating which unfortunately is not an offical FIDE rating. However my Munster League matches count towards those so I should get one of those soon enough. But given the low amount of games which will be used to calculate thatm I don't know how accurate that will be over time.
