description: Roundup of the Club Championship 2017
---
I ended the club championship with two walkover wins. 
This was a fairly disapointing conclusion to the league for me. 
I'm going to drop rating points as I lost my games against higher rated opponents earlier in the league but never got the chance to earn them back by facing players at my own level. 
I'm not sure what can be done to solve the walkover issue but I win about 20% of my games in the league via them which is way too high.
