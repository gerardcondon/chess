description: Round up from day one of the new Munster League season.

The Munster League started back up again in Charleville last weekend. 
The B team were in action and in the first game lost 4 1/2 to 1/2 against the Cork A team. 
In the second game we shared the spoils with Charleville.

For the first [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2017-2018/999-condon-gerard-1.html) we were treated to the luxurious conditions that the A team expects - leather seats, wooden boards and pieces. 
No expense spared! I had a mixed game in a Rubinstein French. 
I was well prepared and only used the increment for the first 20 or so moves and built up a huge time advantage against my much higher rated opponent. 
This was especially useful later once I started to make my customary blunders as my opponent didn't have a great deal of time to find the best moves! 
I got a comfortable, equal endgame position and then hallucinated that my opponent was winning a piece. 
I made some terrible moves and ended up losing most of my pawns giving my opponent had an massively winning position.

Luckily for me he failed to find the win and I managed to trade into a Rook & split a and c pawns against a Rook endgame. 
I had done a great deal of work on my endgames recently with Jesus DeLaVilla's 100 endgames course on [Chessable](https://www.chessable.com/endgame-book/100-endgames-you-must-know/5193/) so I was fairly confident here. 
I held out for 50 moves and only gave one winning chance around move 85. 
Again my opponent failed to find this and I escaped with a draw.

For the second [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2017-2018/condon-gerard-815-2.html) we were back slumming it with the typical B team standard. 
No more leather chairs, plastic sets! I got a bit confused out of the opening against my opponent and ended up in a blocked position. 
I decided to swap my bishop for his knight as I felt that an extra knight would be better suited to the position. 
I ended up getting a really strong position - probably winning as I was up a piece. 
However then it all fell apart for me. 
My opponent got a really strong attack with his queen and my pieces were forced into awkward positions. 
I missed the fact that I could get my queen to e7 via a check on c7. 
If I had found that I think I would have converted the game. 
My opponent offered a draw but I felt that as the match result was hanging on this I should try to play on. 
Naturally I blundered into to a losing position but fortunately got back to draw in the end.
