The club championship continued and I also continued my streak of [losing](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-championship-2016-2017/condon-gerard-593-5.html) to higher rated players. 
I had a chance to get a great position early in the opening with 9. Ng5. 
I looked at it, thought it was good and was going to play it. 
Then however I thought I would take a deeper look, completely miscalculated and convinced myself the move was bad. 
If I was a worse or better player I would have played the move. 
Unfortunately I had just enough knowledge and skill to make a complete mess of things.

After that my opponent got a great attack against my kingside and finished it off nicely. 
I still think I'm messing about with less active moves in these positions and should be more direct on the queenside in future.
