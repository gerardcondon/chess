description: My games from the third round of the Cork Club Championship for the 2016-2017 season

I played my third round in the Club Championship and [lost](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-championship-2016-2017/condon-gerard-572-3.html).
I think I was ok for most of the game but then lost the plot near the end.
I didn't have a clear idea of what I was supposed to be doing during most of the game.
I think I should have brought my rooks over to the queenside early and pushed there.
