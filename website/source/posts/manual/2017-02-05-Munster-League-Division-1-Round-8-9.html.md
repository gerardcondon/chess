description: My games from the rounds 8 and 9 of the Munster League Divison 1 for the 2016-2017 season for the Cork B team.

Rounds 8 and 9 of the Munster League took place on the 5th February and the B team had a tough assignment playing Ennis A home and away.
We lost boths rounds heavily - 1.5-3.5 and 1-4.

I [drew](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/709-condon-gerard-9.html) my first game with black. 
It was a Rubenstein French which ended up in a R+Kn vs R+Kn endgame which we drew by repetition. 
My opponent at one stage around move 21 had a potential sacrifice of his knight on f7.
Even in the analysis afterwards we weren't too sure if it worked out.
One interesting thing is that my opponent spent a lot of time trying to calculate this sacrifice.
I had a similar experience in the last round of the Mulcahy where my opponent spent a lot of time trying to calculate a potential attack.
My new strategy is to get into a position where there is a just plausible enough attack against me so my opponents burn lots of time on their clocks and I end up with a time advantage!

The second [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/condon-gerard-366-10.html) was a complete disaster. 
I had sucessfully navigated my opponents attack and just needed a couple more accurate moves - h4 and knight somewhere - and we would havea level position. 
Instead I didn't realise my pawn was pinned and moved my knight to where it could be taken for nothing.
What an absolute disaster.
We have important games coming up against Limerick so I need to be a lot sharper for those.
