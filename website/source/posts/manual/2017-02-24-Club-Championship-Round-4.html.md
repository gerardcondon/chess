description: My games from the fourth round of the Cork Club Championship for the 2016-2017 season

I played my fourth round in the Club Championship and [won](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-championship-2016-2017/903-condon-gerard-4.html).
I thought I was doing fine and then my opponent sacrificed a knight for a couple of central pawns and an open f-file. 
The computer would have been fine in this position but I wasn't!
The tactical complications were too much.

I played a bad move and after e5 I spent ages trying to find a good response and failed.
All I could see was diagonals opening up for his queen and bishop to complement his open file.
So I sacrificed a piece back and got the queens off and started over again.
I was able to win from when my opponent later dropped a piece.

That's after bringing me back to 50% in the tournament. 
I'm still down a few rating points but they won't be taken into account until the tournament completes so I have time to try to win them back.
