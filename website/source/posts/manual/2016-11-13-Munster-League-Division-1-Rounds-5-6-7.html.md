description: My games from the rounds 5, 6 and 7 of the Munster League Divison 1 for the 2016-2017 season

After our great start it was back down to earth with a wallop for the Cork B team in the last three rounds of the [Munster League](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017.html). 
First a 5-0 hammering at the hands of Cork A (our top scoring team member Walkover didn't show up for this match). 
Then a 4-1 loss to CCYMS followed by another 5-0 beating to Limerick A. 
We're in a bit of a precarious position after the first half of the league but hopefully can grab a few more points after the Christmas break.

For me personally it was a very mixed bag of results. 
I had a good position in my [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/condon-gerard-593-5.html) against Cork A. 
After twenty moves I was thinking that this was the best I'd ever played against a higher rated opponent - I actually understood the ideas in the position and what I could do. 
Then I missed a move to grab a pawn or two and it all fell to pieces after that :) 
No margin for error against 1700-1800ish opponents.

Still I took positives from that game into my next [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/condon-gerard-577-6.html) against a similarly rated opponent. 
I was a bit fortunate here as he achieved a really good position against me. 
Then however I think he pressed to much for an attack and his pieces became uncoordinated. 
I was lucky to trap his rook and ended up winning.

My last [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/condon-gerard-602-7.html) was against someone slightly higher rated than me and we reached a level enough endgame with a slight edge for white due to more centralised pieces. 
I think I could have repeated the position or offered a draw here but instead I kept going. 
Whenever I see Magnus Carlsen he always presses in positions where he has a slight advantage with little chance for him to lose - playing for two results. 
So I decided to try that approach, committed an absolute howler and lost! Still the only way for me to learn about endgames is to play them and I certainly learned a great deal in that loss.

Back to club action for the next few weeks and the leagues resume for us in February.
