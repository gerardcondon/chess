I bounced back in this [round](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-championship-2017-2018/condon-gerard-736-2.html) of the club chapionship. 
My opponent played a kind of King's Indian with c4. 
I was completely unprepared for e5 and thought he should have pushed on with e4.
Once he traded into the isolated pawn position I think I started to gain an advantage and then once he dropped a piece, realistically it was all over. 

I do like my last move Re1. 
I've been doing tactics on Chessibility and one of the things that I've started to learn there is quiet moves to increase the pressure when there is no knockout blow. 
Simon Williams is also stressing this kind of thing in his courses. 
If you don't see an immediate win then bring in the reinforcements.
