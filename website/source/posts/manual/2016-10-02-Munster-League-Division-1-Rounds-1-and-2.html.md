description: My games from the opening round of the Munster League Divison 1 for the 2016-2017 season

The Munster League kicked off again yesterday and Cork B were in division 1. I played [two games](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017.html) with mixed results.

First up was a match against Cork A. Clearly the partying from their title win last season was still ongoing as they only managed to field three team members!. So we started the match with a 2-0 lead ... and then lost our three games to lose the match 3-2. I have to credit my opponent with playing a fine [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/condon-gerard-310-1.html). I missed one move and that was it.

Second was a match against Sarsfields. I was completely lost in my [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/condon-gerard-588-2.html) here and was unbelievely lucky to get a win. Still they all count and we drew the match in the end so I partially atoned for my earlier loss.
