description: My games from the round 14 of the Munster League Divison 1 for the 2016-2017 season for the Cork B team.

My results in the Munster League since Christmas have by and large been terrible and I finished up in the final round in the same manner by [losing](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/577-condon-gerard-15.html) as black.

Looking back on the game I made some bad strategic mistakes that I thought I'd dealt with in these types of positions. 
I went back to aimless developing moves instead of urgent action on the queenside. 
I need to do some work on memorizing opening plans so that I don't make similar mistakes in future.

The AGM after the game was very interesting.
I'd never been at one of these before. 
There are big changes planned for the league in the coming years with a shift to two six team divisions. 
This will be a positive change for us as I think we will enjoy more challenging in a competitive division 2 instead of bringing up the rear in division 1.
