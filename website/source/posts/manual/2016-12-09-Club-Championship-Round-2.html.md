description: My games from the second round of the Cork Club Championship for the 2016-2017 season

I played the [second round](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-championship-2016-2017/819-condon-gerard-2.html) of the Cork Club Championship and lost.
My opponent was feeling a bit under the weather, so to go home early he launched a speculative attack which succeeded!
I should bring Lemsip to these games in future.

The computer says I had a chance to turn things around near the end by playing Bb8 on move 28. 
I think in practical terms it would have been very hard to spot that as my attention was focused on the pieces around the king and not the other side of the board. 
It's an instructive idea though - the mate threat keeps my opponent's queen pinned to the h file and allows me to trade it off and so end the attack.
