Last Friday we kicked off the Cork Chess Club [Championship](http://corkchess.com/club-championship/draw/) for the new season. 

I won my first [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-championship-2016-2017/condon-gerard-814-1.html). My opponent missed a pin against his rook in the middlegame and I was able to win material from there.
