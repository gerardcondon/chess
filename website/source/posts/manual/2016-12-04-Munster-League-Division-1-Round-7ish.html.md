description: My games from the round 7 of the Munster League Divison 1 for the 2016-2017 season for the Cork A team.

Round 7 of the Munster League continued and naturally the A team didn't have a full team. 
There were no B team games this weekend though so I was able to play up for them.

I managed to win my [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/665-condon-gerard-8.html) after my opponent miscalculated a tactic dropping a bishop for a couple of pawns. 
I went into an endgame with a knight and rook against a rook and two extra pawns and coverted it. 

This meant that the A team drew the match 2.5 - 2.5. 
I'll be expecting a trophy at the end of the season if they win the Championship!
