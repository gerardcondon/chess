My first game in this year's club championship ended in a loss. 
I was kind of ok out of the opening but ended up in a cramped position. 
I played well enough to get out of that and gave myself a shot with a tactic on move X.

<%= insert_fen_diagram("%228%2F5k2%2F8%2FR7%2FP7%2F3K4%2F8%2Fr7+b+-+-+0+1%22" ,"Critical Position: Qh3 was a must here") %>

Unfortunately I wasn't able to calculate it well enough. 
I felt that Qh3+ was the move to play but I didn't see what to do after Qg2. 
Putting it in a computer it says to just grab the f pawn and even if white picks up the exchange, I still have three pawns for it. 
Once I missed the tactic, I was wiped off the board. 
Players are ruthless that way at the 1800 level.
