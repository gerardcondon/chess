My first [game](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-championship-2017-2018/919-condon-gerard-1.html) in this year's club championship ended in a loss. 
I was kind of ok out of the opening but ended up in a cramped position. 
I played well enough to get out of that and gave myself a shot with a tactic on move 27.

<%= insert_fen_diagram("%224rr1k%2Fp4pp1%2F1ppN1n1p%2F4p2q%2F3PP1b1%2F1BP2PP1%2FP3Q1K1%2F3RR3+b+-+-+1+27%22" ,"Critical Position: Qh3 was a must here") %>

Unfortunately I wasn't able to calculate it well enough. 
I felt that Qh3+ was the move to play but I didn't see what to do after Qg2. 
Putting it in a computer it says to just grab the f pawn and even if white picks up the exchange, I still have three pawns for it. 
Once I missed the tactic, I was wiped off the board. 
Players are ruthless that way at the 1800 level.
