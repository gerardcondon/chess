I've posted the games from the Zurich 1953 tournament [here](https://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/zurich-1953/zurich-1953.html).
This tournament was featured in a few books, notably [David Bronstein's](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Zurich-International-Chess-Tournament-Dover-ebook/dp/B00BX1DPE8/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1) and [Miguel Najdorf's](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Zurich-1953-Contenders-World-Championship/dp/1936490439/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1449534738&sr=8-2&keywords=1953+zurich).
