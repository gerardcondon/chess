Cork B are the Munster League Division 2 Champions! Needed to win both of our matches against Charleville on the last day and we  just about did it - came down to the last game!

I was only able to play one of the three days for this but luckily enough it was the day that we won the division, so I get into the photos of the winning lineup! I pulled a similar stunt last year with the Division 1 team.

I've posted the [two games](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-2-2016/munster-league-division-2-2016.html) I played in this year's competition. Here are the reports on the [Cork Chess site](http://corkchess.com/munster-league/) and the [Munster League Site](http://www.munsterchessunion.org). Here's to next year and Division 1.
