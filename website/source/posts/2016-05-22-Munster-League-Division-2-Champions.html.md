Cork B are the Division 2 Champions. I was only able to play one of the three days for this but luckily enough it was the day that we won the division, so I get into the photos of the winning lineup! I pulled a similar stunt last year with the Division 1 team.

I've posted the two games I played in this year's competition. Here's to next year and Division 1.
