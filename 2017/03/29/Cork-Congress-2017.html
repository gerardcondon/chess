          </h5>
          <p>The Cork Congress happened over the weekend of 29th-31st March and I didn&#39;t do too bad in it. 
          I finished third in my section and got some cash for my troubles!
          The event was very well organised - great credit must go to those at the club who ran the tournament. </p>
          
          <p>Thankfully this year didn&#39;t coincide with the clocks changing but it did share the hotel with a Fawlty Towers show!
          It&#39;s a bit sureal to be playing the game and hearing Basil&#39;s German speech coming from the adjacent room.
          At times during my games I wished I was in that show rather than at the chess board!</p>
          
          <p>My first <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-congress-2017/835-condon-gerard-1.html">game</a> was a long draw. 
          I got an ok position as black in the QGD but then lost the plot a bit and got into some trouble.
          I managed to get into a rook endgame where both of us were threatening to promote.
          I picked up an extra pawn here at this stage but when things simplified it was into a theoretically drawn position.
          I could and probably should have played on here but my brain was frazzled and I was down to a couple of minutes.
          My opponent had offered a draw and I accepted.
          One of my problems here is that I know the position is a draw but I&#39;m not sure what to try to do to complicate it and win.
          In future if I have this position, I think I would play it until the pawn endgame and see what happens.</p>
          
          <p>I was paired against an unrated opponent in the next round so I had no idea of how strong he was.
          It was a crazy <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-congress-2017/condon-gerard-760-2.html">game</a>. He attacked on the kingside and I on the queenside. 
          I held him off and I think I had a good position before it all went to pieces in mutual time trouble.
          I missed a win with Nxc6 - I managed to miscalculate this both during the game and also in the post mortem.
          He managed to get a pawn on f3 and with the way my pawns were arranged I realised I had serious back rank issues.
          Thankfully he missed some critical moves and I managed to get a win when he blundered his rook.</p>
          
          <p>The next <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-congress-2017/961-condon-gerard-3.html">round</a> had me as black against the French Exchange. 
          I always think that this is the variation to go for as white as the pawn structures and positions are completely different to the other French variations.
          I&#39;ve had good results though with it but I&#39;d struggle to find a coherent plan or common thread in my Exchange games.
          I equalised fairly easily in this game but wasn&#39;t sure where to go from there.
          I had a bye booked for the fourth round so when my opponent offered a draw and I didn&#39;t see much of a plan I took the opportunity to knock off early for the day. 
          The idea was to come back more refreshed the next day and try again.</p>
          
          <p>Realistically this bye and the two draws put me out of contention for the top prize from early on but I was enjoying myself playing at this more relaxed pace.</p>
          
          <p>The first <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-congress-2017/condon-gerard-642-4.html">game</a> on the Sunday morning was another King&#39;s Indian game. 
          I tend to lump these in with the Dutch and various kingside fianchetto games as they all seem to end up in similar positions.
          I think I&#39;m learning in these positions. Up to now I tended to mess around on the queenside too much with unnecessary preparation moves. 
          This time I just went for it with the attitude that if he survived my attack and countered then fine - but at least I&#39;d get an attack in first. 
          This worked out well for me and I won an exchange just out of the opening. 
          I slowly increased the pressure and managed to convert the win. 
          I may have had an easier win on move 26 with Bxf7 Qxf7, Nxe5 Bxe5, Rd8+ getting the piece back and gaining a pawn. 
          I was worried that my rook may find it hard to get back out but going over this after the game I think it would have been fine. 
          I went for the more solid option and eventually my opponent flagged in a lost position.</p>
          
          <p>My last <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-congress-2017/552-condon-gerard-5.html">game</a> in the tournament was one in which I was fortunate to get a win. 
          I thought I was winning a piece after the opening but in reality it just forced him into playing it as a sacrificial attack! I had to give back the piece to survive. 
          I think I took my longest think ever for a move on Qc7 - about 30 mins. 
          My opponent waited a bit, went away, got a coffee, came back and still had to wait for another 10 minutes. 
          I was thinking that I was in trouble during the game but on the computer I&#39;m perfectly fine. 
          I have great trouble evaluating these kinds of positions. 
          In the endgame I think he should have tried to keep on both rooks as that would have been far more drawish. 
          Once I won a pawn and traded off the rooks, the King and pawn endgame was always going to be good for me and eventually I queened and won the game.</p>
          
          <p>In the end I won a prize for joint third place in my section. 
          I even gained a few rating points! 
          All in all a good tournament for me.</p>
