              <a href="../03/29/Cork-Congress-2017.html">Cork Congress 2017</a>
            </h5>
            <p>The Cork Congress happened over the weekend of 29th-31st March and I didn&#39;t do too bad in it. 
            I finished third in my section and got some cash for my troubles!
            The event was very well organised - great credit must go to those at the club who ran the tournament. </p>
            
            <p>Thankfully this year didn&#39;t coincide with the clocks changing but it did share the hotel with a Fawlty Towers show!
            It&#39;s a bit sureal to be playing the game and hearing Basil&#39;s German speech coming from the adjacent room.
            At times during my games I wished I was in that show rather than at the chess board!</p>
            
            <p>My first <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-congress-2017/835-condon-gerard-1.html">game</a> was a long draw. 
            I got an ok position as black in the QGD but then lost the plot a bit and got into some trouble.
            I managed to get into a rook endgame where both of us were threatening to promote.
            I picked up an extra pawn here at this stage but when things simplified it was into a theoretically drawn position.
            I could and probably should have played on here but my brain was frazzled and I was down to a couple of minutes.
            My opponent had offered a draw and I accepted.
            One of my problems here is that I know the position is a draw but I&#39;m not sure what to try to do to complicate it and win.
            In future if I have this position, I think I would play it until the pawn endgame and see what happens.</p>
            
            <p>I was paired against an unrated opponent in the next round so I had no idea of how strong he was.
            It was a crazy <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-congress-2017/condon-gerard-760-2.html">game</a>. He attacked on the kingside and I on the queenside. 
            I held him off and I think I had a good position before it all went to pieces in mutual time trouble.
            I missed a win with Nxc6 - I managed to miscalculate this both during the game and also in the post mortem.
            He managed to get a pawn on f3 and with the way my pawns were arranged I realised I had serious back rank issues.
            Thankfully he missed some critical moves and I managed to get a win when he blundered his rook.</p>
            
            <p>The next <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-congress-2017/961-condon-gerard-3.html">round</a> had me as black against the French Exchange. 
            I always think that this is the variation to go for as white as the pawn structures and positions are completely different to the other French variations.
            I&#39;ve had good results though with it but I&#39;d struggle to find a coherent plan or common thread in my Exchange games.
            I equalised fairly easily in this game but wasn&#39;t sure where to go from there.
            I had a bye booked for the fourth round so when my opponent offered a draw and I didn&#39;t see much of a plan I took the opportunity to knock off early for the day. 
            The idea was to come back more refreshed the next day and try again.</p>
            
            <p>Realistically this bye and the two draws put me out of contention for the top prize from early on but I was enjoying myself playing at this more relaxed pace.</p>
            
            <p>The first <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-congress-2017/condon-gerard-642-4.html">game</a> on the Sunday morning was another King&#39;s Indian game. 
            I tend to lump these in with the Dutch and various kingside fianchetto games as they all seem to end up in similar positions.
            I think I&#39;m learning in these positions. Up to now I tended to mess around on the queenside too much with unnecessary preparation moves. 
            This time I just went for it with the attitude that if he survived my attack and countered then fine - but at least I&#39;d get an attack in first. 
            This worked out well for me and I won an exchange just out of the opening. 
            I slowly increased the pressure and managed to convert the win. 
            I may have had an easier win on move 26 with Bxf7 Qxf7, Nxe5 Bxe5, Rd8+ getting the piece back and gaining a pawn. 
            I was worried that my rook may find it hard to get back out but going over this after the game I think it would have been fine. 
            I went for the more solid option and eventually my opponent flagged in a lost position.</p>
            
            <p>My last <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-congress-2017/552-condon-gerard-5.html">game</a> in the tournament was one in which I was fortunate to get a win. 
            I thought I was winning a piece after the opening but in reality it just forced him into playing it as a sacrificial attack! I had to give back the piece to survive. 
            I think I took my longest think ever for a move on Qc7 - about 30 mins. 
            My opponent waited a bit, went away, got a coffee, came back and still had to wait for another 10 minutes. 
            I was thinking that I was in trouble during the game but on the computer I&#39;m perfectly fine. 
            I have great trouble evaluating these kinds of positions. 
            In the endgame I think he should have tried to keep on both rooks as that would have been far more drawish. 
            Once I won a pawn and traded off the rooks, the King and pawn endgame was always going to be good for me and eventually I queened and won the game.</p>
            
            <p>In the end I won a prize for joint third place in my section. 
            I even gained a few rating points! 
            All in all a good tournament for me.</p>

              <a href="../03/26/Munster-League-Division-1-Round-10-11.html">Munster League Division 1. Rounds 10 and 11.</a>
            </h5>
            <p>This was a bad day for us in the Munster League. 
            We lost both our matches to Adare and Limerick B. 
            The Limerick B match was especially bad as they now leapfrogged over us in the table.</p>
            
            <p>I was close to getting a draw against a much higher opponent in my first <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/condon-gerard-387-11.html">game</a> but lost a crucial pawn in the endgame and went down from there. 
            The second <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/440-condon-gerard-12.html">game</a> was a disaster for me. 
            I got a slightly better position going into the endgame - my opponent had an isolated pawn - but then I lost a piece to a pawn fork and with it, the game.</p>
            
            <p>On a more amusing note, the Munster Chess Union got a little confused as to what game we were playing. We&#39;d probably have had a better chance in the rugby!</p>

            </h5>
            <p>The club championship continued and I also continued my streak of <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-championship-2016-2017/condon-gerard-593-5.html">losing</a> to higher rated players. 
            I had a chance to get a great position early in the opening with 9. Ng5. 
            I looked at it, thought it was good and was going to play it. 
            Then however I thought I would take a deeper look, completely miscalculated and convinced myself the move was bad. 
            If I was a worse or better player I would have played the move. 
            Unfortunately I had just enough knowledge and skill to make a complete mess of things.</p>
            
            <p>After that my opponent got a great attack against my kingside and finished it off nicely. 
            I still think I&#39;m messing about with less active moves in these positions and should be more direct on the queenside in future.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.chess.com/article/view/pro-chess-league-guide">Pro Chess League</a> was interesting but I didn&#39;t watch it often as there was no easy way to just watch one team&#39;s games so I couldn&#39;t easily track how the Irish team were doing. Hopefully next year each time will have their own page on the site showing just their games.</p>

            </h5>
            <p>I played my fourth round in the Club Championship and <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-championship-2016-2017/903-condon-gerard-4.html">won</a>.
            I thought I was doing fine and then my opponent sacrificed a knight for a couple of central pawns and an open f-file. 
            The computer would have been fine in this position but I wasn&#39;t!
            The tactical complications were too much.</p>
            
            <p>I played a bad move and after e5 I spent ages trying to find a good response and failed.
            All I could see was diagonals opening up for his queen and bishop to complement his open file.
            So I sacrificed a piece back and got the queens off and started over again.
            I was able to win from when my opponent later dropped a piece.</p>
            
            <p>That&#39;s after bringing me back to 50% in the tournament. 
            I&#39;m still down a few rating points but they won&#39;t be taken into account until the tournament completes so I have time to try to win them back.</p>

            <p>Games for the 7th round of the Munster league were backdated in the rating system recently so I had a personal record rating of 1548 in December. Unfortunately the Mulcahy brought that down since.</p>

            </h5>
            <p>Rounds 8 and 9 of the Munster League took place on the 5th February and the B team had a tough assignment playing Ennis A home and away.
            We lost boths rounds heavily - 1.5-3.5 and 1-4.</p>
            
            <p>I <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/709-condon-gerard-9.html">drew</a> my first game with black. 
            It was a Rubenstein French which ended up in a R+Kn vs R+Kn endgame which we drew by repetition. 
            My opponent at one stage around move 21 had a potential sacrifice of his knight on f7.
            Even in the analysis afterwards we weren&#39;t too sure if it worked out.
            One interesting thing is that my opponent spent a lot of time trying to calculate this sacrifice.
            I had a similar experience in the last round of the Mulcahy where my opponent spent a lot of time trying to calculate a potential attack.
            My new strategy is to get into a position where there is a just plausible enough attack against me so my opponents burn lots of time on their clocks and I end up with a time advantage!</p>
            
            <p>The second <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/condon-gerard-366-10.html">game</a> was a complete disaster. 
            I had sucessfully navigated my opponents attack and just needed a couple more accurate moves - h4 and knight somewhere - and we would havea level position. 
            Instead I didn&#39;t realise my pawn was pinned and moved my knight to where it could be taken for nothing.
            What an absolute disaster.
            We have important games coming up against Limerick so I need to be a lot sharper for those.</p>

            I think I was ok for most of the game but then lost the plot near the end.
            I didn&#39;t have a clear idea of what I was supposed to be doing during most of the game.
