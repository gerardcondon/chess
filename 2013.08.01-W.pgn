1.e4 e6 2.c3 {Haven't seen this before but I think that if I just move d5 then I will transpose to the normal French Defense.} 2...d5 3.e5 c5 {I'm not sure what the book move for the advance French is. I'm fairly sure that I need to play c5 and f6 at some point. I think c5 normally comes before f6 in the advance so I'm going to play that now.} 4.d4 Nc6 {Attacking d4 and also once we exchange on d4, it will attack e5.} 5.Nf3 {Protects d4 and e6. This blocks the queen to the kingside so I don't need to worry about immediate Qg5 ideas.} 5...Bd7 {Think this is the move recommended by Simon Williams. The bishop belongs here anyway - until it can move somewhere better - so may as well move it now.} 6.Be2 {-- GC-- I think this is the wrong diagonal for the white bishop. It is blocked by the knight from going to the Kingside. I think d3 is a better square here. -- GC -- What do I know. It turns out that Be2 is the main variation listed by Simon Williams in response to Bd7.} 6...cxd4 {In the lines shown by Simon Williams he typically doesn't make this capture on d4. He recommends that black usually castle queenside in these lines and sometimes play c4 to close up the queenside. Not knowing the analysis my thinking behind this was to exchange on d4 in order to create a target on d4. Also I can play the f6 break after this exchange.}
    ( 6...f6 {This is the line recommended by Simon Williams.} )
7.cxd4 {Pretty much forced to take back with the pawn. Otherwise left with a pawn on c3 blocking the square for the knight.} 7...f6 {Played the f6 break to attack his center pawns.} 8.Nc3 {Develops the knight to a good square.}
    ( 8.exf6 Nxf6 9.Nc3 {This may have been better than getting his pawn on e5. That always proved hard to support for him. Now he has a backward pawn to target on e6.} )
8...fxe5 {He didn't take on f6 - instead developing Nc3 so I'm going to take on e5.} 9.Bg5
    ( 9.Nxe5 Nxe5 10.dxe5 Ne7 11.O-O )
9...Be7 10.Bxe7? {Very strange trading off this bishop. He never really regained any means of threatening the dark squares around black's position.} 10...Ngxe7 {This sequence was a bit odd from white's point of view. He spent two moves to trade off a useful piece for him. At the end of this I've traded off a piece that I was not sure what to do with anyway and I've developed a knight to a good square. Also I'm now free to castle.} 11.Nxe5 {Don't agree with this move as it removes a defender of the e5 square. I think retaking with the pawn would have been better.}
    ( 11.dxe5 Ng6 {Maybe retaking with the pawn wasn't so good. Can't see how he holds onto e5.} )
11...Nxe5 12.dxe5 {I think that knight was too powerful on e5 so I swapped him off. Now he has a pawn there which can be annoying if it is supported. On the other hand I have a target to aim for. And I have a protected passed pawn.} 12...O-O {Castling short is good for black in this position. The f file is half open and my rook is attacking down it.} 13.Qd4?! {Protects his pawn and the f2 square. A lot of my subsequent plans were about how to get rid of that protection. I'm not a big fan of this move as it exposes his queen to a lot of attacks and threats by black pieces. Not sure what else he could have done to protect e5 in the long term. I think the mistake was getting that pawn to e5 without a way to safely protect it. Really he should have had a rook on e1 if he wanted that pawn on e5.}
    ( 13.O-O {The computer suggests castling and then Qc2 and Bd3 targeting the h7 square.} )
13...Nf5 {Immediately attacks the queen forcing it to move. The other idea I had for the knight was to go to g6. This attacks e5. However I think it is at risk of being traded off there by the white bishop leaving me with a shattered pawn structure in front of my king. I think my bishop is better there to protect against this.} 14.Qb4 {Second queen move. Admittedly forced but he drew that on himself by bringing out the queen to an advanced central square.} 14...Qc7! {Protect my c7 pawn and attack e5. I was expecting him to play Rc1 here and threaten discovered attacks against my queen with his knight.}
    ( 14...d4 15.Nb5 Bc6 {The computer suggests instead the d4 and Bc6 ideas. The queen can potentially come to g5 or d5. I never considered this in the game. I assumed that I'd want the d5 pawn protected by the e6 pawn.} )
15.Qf4 {I think this is a bad move. He's moving his queen a lot - third queen move in a row - and still has to complete his development. Also he opens himself up to discovered attacks against the queen when the knight moves.} 15...Qb6 {I give up the attack on the e5 square but now threaten the f2 square - linking up with my rook. I also threaten the b2 pawn. He can't play Na5 because of my white bishop.}
    ( 15...d4 {The computer suggests d4 picking up the knight. If white moves the knight then ne3 with a discovered attack on the queen is very strong. The knight can then jump to c2 and fork king and rook.} )
16.Rb1 {I'm happy enough for him to play moves like this. B1 is not a good square for his rook.}
    ( 16.b3 Rac8 17.Rc1 {and white should castle if he can. The rook is much better on c1 than b1} 17...Qa5 18.Qd2 d4 19.Nd1 Qxe5 20.Rxc8 Rxc8 21.O-O {this variation is not great for white either. The central pawns look very powerful} )
16...Rac8 {I'm threatening to take the knight with my rook. He can't capture back with the pawn due to his unprotected rook on b1.} 17.O-O! {Protects rook on b1 and the f2 square.} 17...Be8 {Transferring the bishop to g6. From there it will attack the rook on b1.} 18.Rfc1 {Protects the knight and moves the rook to the open file.} 18...Bg6 {This bishop is on a good square now and threatening his rook on b1. It could also provide support if my rook could come to c2. It's usually a sign that things are going well for black in the French Defense if his light squared bishop becomes a strong piece. Given that I think we can say that black's opening was a success.} 19.Rd1 {I had thought of moving the knight to d4 as part of the discovered attack on the queen and rook. From there it could threaten taking on e2 with check. This rook move prevents that.} 19...Ne7! {This moves attacks the queen and rook. White must at least lose an exchange. I was a bit concerned about the clock at this time. I was down to 6 minutes and white had about double that. There may be better ways to maintain the pressure and lead to better tactics. However I decided to try to simplify and liquidate to a good ending. My plan for the knight was to come to g6 after e7 and threaten e5.} 20.Qg3 {The queen needs to move somewhere where she can still keep an eye on f2. H4 and e3 were other options.}
    ( 20.Qe3 Qxe3 21.fxe3 Bxb1 22.Rxb1 Ng6 23.Bg4 Rc6 {This line looks terrible for white. The doubled pawns are bad and I don't see how e5 can be saved. Clearly the queen can't go to e3.} )
    ( 20.Qh4 {Probably better than g3 as it attacks the black knight on e7. However I think the game would still have played out the same after Bxb1.} )
20...Bxb1
    ( 20...Rxc3 21.bxc3 Bxb1 {Could have taken with the rook first. This wins an extra piece instead of an exchange and pawns.} )
21.Rxb1? {This recapture with the rook is bad as it allows tactics on c3. The b2 pawn is pinned as the rook is undefended. This means that c3 is not protected by the b2 pawn.}
    ( 21.Nxb1 Qxb2 {threatening qxe2} 22.Bg4 {threatening to take on e6 with check} 22...Qb6 )
21...Rxc3 {Loses the knight. Can't recapture with the pawn as the queen takes the rook. Can't recapture with the queen as qxf2 and then the bishop.} 22.Bd3
    ( 22.Qxc3 Qxf2+ 23.Kh1 Qxe2 24.Qc5 {recapturing the black rook on c3 with the queen leads to the loss of the bishop and pawn.} 24...Rf1+ 25.Rxf1 Qxf1+ 26.Qg1 Qxg1+ 27.Kxg1 Nc6 {Forced liquidation to a won ending.  28...Nxe5 })
    ( 22.bxc3 Qxb1+ 23.Bf1 {taking with the pawn loses the rook. White's queenside pawns are very weak and his bishop is pinned to f1.} )
22...Rxd3 {giving back an exchange but if qxd3 then this exposes f2.} 23.Qxd3 Rxf2 {I didn't see black's next move when I played this. Even so I'm not sure that taking with the queen would have been that much better. Maybe white would have gotten counterplay against the queenside pawns.}
    ( 23...Qxf2+ 24.Kh1 Qf5 )
24.Kh1 {Completely missed this. Thought I would have a discovered check by moving my rook next turn.} 24...Ng6 {Attacking the pawn on e5. Long term can tie down white's queen protecting this. Don't think his rook can properly defend it due to back rank threats}
    ( 24...Rxb2 {Computer suggests taking on b2. Black can't really do anything as his queen is tied down protecting against back rank mates.} )
25.Qc3 Rf8 {Was afraid of back rank threats. Not sure if white has anything more than spite checks.} 26.Qg3 {Aimless moves with the queen but he doesn't have much else.} 26...Qa6 {Targeting the pawn on a2 and the f1 square.}
    ( 26...Qxb2 27.Qe1 Qxe5 28.Qxe5 Nxe5 {I could have taken the pawn on b2. White cannot move the rook from the back rank due to mating threats by the rook} )
27.Rg1 {didn't see the point of this orginally but now can see that by playing this it means that he is not forced to take my rook when it comes to f1.} 27...Rf1? {swaps of a pair of rooks. simplifying makes my material advantage stronger as I have 2 pieces to 1 as opposed to 3 pieces to 2.}
    ( 27...Qxa2 28.Qc3 Qa6 {should have taken the pawn on move 27. I had thought that I could swap of the queens also by moving Rf1 but I really don't know what I was thinking there.} )
28.Qc3 {threatens Qc8+ getting the queen into the black position. I missed this move - didn't see that he could just ignore the rook on f1.} 28...Rxg1+ 29.Kxg1 Qb6+ {The check allows my queen to come to the black back rank. This cuts off any checks and eliminates any black counterplay.} 30.Kf1 Qd8 {From here my plan was to push the d pawn. Best case it promotes. Worst case I lose it but force swapping off the queens. Either case is a winning position for black.} 31.Qa3?? {Poor move. Allows black to trade off the queens. Endgame is completely winning as there is nothing to counteract the knight.} 31...Qf8+ {Forcing the trade of the queens. Nothing can save the e5 pawn now.} 32.Qxf8+ Kxf8 {From here the win was fairly mechanical. My basic ideas were to drive the d and e pawns forward with the knight protecting the rearmost ones of these. That way the white king could never capture the pawns as even if he was able to get to the knight, the pawn would have promoted in the meantime. I also planned to advance my king whenever possible and driving his king back.} 33.Ke2 Nxe5 34.Kd2 Ke7 35.Ke3 Kd6 36.Kd4 Nc6+ 37.Kc3 e5 38.Kd3 e4+ 39.Ke2 Ke5 40.g4 {When he started advancing his side pawns I wanted to make sure that my pawns would either capture his or block their way. I didn't want to let him get any advanced pawns or passed pawns.} 40...d4 41.h4 e3 42.Kf3 g6
    ( 42...Nb4 43.a3 Nc2 {may have been quicker} 44.Ke2 Ke4 { 45...d3+ })
43.a3 b5 44.h5 gxh5 45.gxh5 h6 46.b4 a6 47.Ke2 Ke4 48.Kf1 d3 49.Ke1 Nd4 50.Kd1 e2+ {using checks prevents any risk of stalemates} 51.Kc1 e1=Q+ 52.Kb2 Qd2+ 53.Kb1 Qc2+ 54.Ka1 Nb3# 0-1
