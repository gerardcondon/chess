          </h5>
          <p>This was a bad day for us in the Munster League. 
          We lost both our matches to Adare and Limerick B. 
          The Limerick B match was especially bad as they now leapfrogged over us in the table.</p>
          
          <p>I was close to getting a draw against a much higher opponent in my first <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/condon-gerard-387-11.html">game</a> but lost a crucial pawn in the endgame and went down from there. 
          The second <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/440-condon-gerard-12.html">game</a> was a disaster for me. 
          I got a slightly better position going into the endgame - my opponent had an isolated pawn - but then I lost a piece to a pawn fork and with it, the game.</p>
          
          <p>On a more amusing note, the Munster Chess Union got a little confused as to what game we were playing. We&#39;d probably have had a better chance in the rugby!</p>

            <a href="../../2017/03/24/Club-Championship-Round-5.html">Cork Club Championship Round 5</a>
          </h5>
          <p>The club championship continued and I also continued my streak of <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-championship-2016-2017/condon-gerard-593-5.html">losing</a> to higher rated players. 
          I had a chance to get a great position early in the opening with 9. Ng5. 
          I looked at it, thought it was good and was going to play it. 
          Then however I thought I would take a deeper look, completely miscalculated and convinced myself the move was bad. 
          If I was a worse or better player I would have played the move. 
          Unfortunately I had just enough knowledge and skill to make a complete mess of things.</p>
          
          <p>After that my opponent got a great attack against my kingside and finished it off nicely. 
          I still think I&#39;m messing about with less active moves in these positions and should be more direct on the queenside in future.</p>

          <p>The <a href="https://www.chess.com/article/view/pro-chess-league-guide">Pro Chess League</a> was interesting but I didn&#39;t watch it often as there was no easy way to just watch one team&#39;s games so I couldn&#39;t easily track how the Irish team were doing. Hopefully next year each time will have their own page on the site showing just their games.</p>

            <a href="../../2017/02/24/Club-Championship-Round-4.html">Cork Club Championship Round 4</a>
          </h5>
          <p>I played my fourth round in the Club Championship and <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-championship-2016-2017/903-condon-gerard-4.html">won</a>.
          I thought I was doing fine and then my opponent sacrificed a knight for a couple of central pawns and an open f-file. 
          The computer would have been fine in this position but I wasn&#39;t!
          The tactical complications were too much.</p>
          
          <p>I played a bad move and after e5 I spent ages trying to find a good response and failed.
          All I could see was diagonals opening up for his queen and bishop to complement his open file.
          So I sacrificed a piece back and got the queens off and started over again.
          I was able to win from when my opponent later dropped a piece.</p>
          
          <p>That&#39;s after bringing me back to 50% in the tournament. 
          I&#39;m still down a few rating points but they won&#39;t be taken into account until the tournament completes so I have time to try to win them back.</p>

          <p>Games for the 7th round of the Munster league were backdated in the rating system recently so I had a personal record rating of 1548 in December. Unfortunately the Mulcahy brought that down since.</p>

            <a href="../../2017/02/05/Munster-League-Division-1-Round-8-9.html">Munster League Division 1. Rounds 8 and 9.</a>
          </h5>
          <p>Rounds 8 and 9 of the Munster League took place on the 5th February and the B team had a tough assignment playing Ennis A home and away.
          We lost boths rounds heavily - 1.5-3.5 and 1-4.</p>
          
          <p>I <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/709-condon-gerard-9.html">drew</a> my first game with black. 
          It was a Rubenstein French which ended up in a R+Kn vs R+Kn endgame which we drew by repetition. 
          My opponent at one stage around move 21 had a potential sacrifice of his knight on f7.
          Even in the analysis afterwards we weren&#39;t too sure if it worked out.
          One interesting thing is that my opponent spent a lot of time trying to calculate this sacrifice.
          I had a similar experience in the last round of the Mulcahy where my opponent spent a lot of time trying to calculate a potential attack.
          My new strategy is to get into a position where there is a just plausible enough attack against me so my opponents burn lots of time on their clocks and I end up with a time advantage!</p>
          
          <p>The second <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/munster-league-division-1-2016-2017/condon-gerard-366-10.html">game</a> was a complete disaster. 
          I had sucessfully navigated my opponents attack and just needed a couple more accurate moves - h4 and knight somewhere - and we would havea level position. 
          Instead I didn&#39;t realise my pawn was pinned and moved my knight to where it could be taken for nothing.
          What an absolute disaster.
          We have important games coming up against Limerick so I need to be a lot sharper for those.</p>

          </h5>
          <p>I played my third round in the Club Championship and <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-championship-2016-2017/condon-gerard-572-3.html">lost</a>.
          I think I was ok for most of the game but then lost the plot near the end.
          I didn&#39;t have a clear idea of what I was supposed to be doing during most of the game.
          I think I should have brought my rooks over to the queenside early and pushed there.</p>

          <p>I came agonizingly close to winning my third round <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess/cork-club-ladder-2016-2017/793-condon-gerard-3.html">game</a> in the Cork Club Ladder. 
          I had a winning position (+2.5 on the computer) at the end at move 36 and my opponent was running really short on time. 
          I just needed to make one accurate move to bring out my knight instead of my bishop. 
          Unfortunately I brought out the bishop first and let his rook in and lost from there.</p>
