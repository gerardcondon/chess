### PGN

This repository contains
* PGN files for my chess games organised by tournament
* ruby code to create new empty pgn files for tournaments and games

### Rakefile

To create a new tournament folder run `rake create_tournament` and input the game data as prompted.
This will create the folder and a pgn file for each game. These files can be edited afterwards in any chess program of your choice.
