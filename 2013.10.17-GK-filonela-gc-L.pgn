1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5  { Standard French Defense}  3. Nc3  { Winawer variation}  3... Nf6  { Simon Williams recommends Bb4 here - pinning the knight on c3. In the Winawer I should be prepared to make this bishop for knight exchange. Also this knight should come to e7 in a lot of variations. Putting it here on f6 allows the pin by the white dark squared bishop.}  4. Bg5  { Pins the King. The threat here is e5.}  4... Be7  { Protecting against e5. If black plays that then I can just move the knight somewhere.}  5. e5  { Attacks the knight. I need to move the knight. The only square is to d7. This blocks a square that my light squared bishop can develop to. Developing this knight to f6 seems to have been a mistake now. Maybe an e7-f5 or h6 to f5 approach would have been better.}  5... Nfd7  { Retreat the knight to avoid losing it.}  6. h4  { This move threw me. I could see the threat - move the pawn down the board and bash into my pawn structure. I can win the pawn with my bsihop and queen but then this leaves a dangerous file open with a white rook already on it.}  6... Bxg5  { I decided to take the pawn and take my chances. I didn't see any good alternatives. My bishop is pinned and I couldn't easily extract my queen from the pin. Whites next moves would have been to develop his queen, light-squared bishop and g1 knight and I think this attack would be crushing against my kingside.}  7. hxg5 Qxg5 8. Qd3  { Develops the queen and attacks the pawn on h6.}  8... g6  { This looks horribly weakening. The other option was h6 but I think I didn't like the idea of the light-squared bishop coming to h5. I may have to play g6 to protect against that anyway. Also white doesn't have a dark-squared bishop so can't use that to control the weakened dark squares.}  ( 8... h5  { Computer suggests h5}  9. Nf3 Qe7 10. O-O-O Nc6 11. Be2 Nb6 12. Qe3 Bd7 ) 9. Nf3  { Good developing move - gaining a tempo on the queen. I am already falling way behind in development here.}  9... Qe7  { No where else to retreat the queen.}  10. O-O-O  { Castles. This lines up the rook with the queen.}  10... a6  { I was worried about pieces coming to b5 and possibly pinning the d7 knight to the king. Or the knight could come there and then threaten c7.}  11. Qd2  { Moving the queen to the dark squares allows him to move in future to my kingside.}  11... c5  { I wanted to make room for my pieces and try to get some counterplay. The c5 break is a standard one in the french defense. I need to play this before I can play nc6. The other break is f6 but I thought my kingside was looking shaky enough.}  12. dxc5 Nxc5  { Now I have the d7 square to develop a piece to.}  13. Qf4  { Looking to move in on the dark squares.}  13... Nc6  { I needed to develop in a hurry. My plan was bd7 and castle queenside.}  14. Be2  { develops the bishop and connects the rooks.}  14... b5  { After Bd7, I was afraid of a3 and b4 trapping the knight. I wanted to make a sqaure available for developing the bishop to b7 and retreating the knight to d7. In retrospect, I think that this is too slow though. I should have developed to d7 and castled. If he attacks the knight then I could have moved it to e4 and given the pawn back but with a defendable position. I think its around here that my position falls apart. Note: the computer says that this move is not too bad compared to the alternatives and recommends it over the alternatives.}  ( 14... Bd7 15. a3 O-O-O 16. b4 Ne4 17. Nxe4 dxe4 18. Qxe4 ) 15. Ng5 $1  { Dual attack. Threatens the f7 square. My queen is tied down to defend this. Also threatens the h7 square.}  15... h5 $2  { Defends the h7 pawn but means that I can't evict the knight now. h6 doesn't work as after the knight moves, the pawn is attacked twice anyway by the queen and rook. Should have given up the pawn as my queenside problems had higher priority.}  ( 15... Bb7 16. Nxh7 O-O-O  { And now my position is much more secure than what I got in the game.}  ) 16. Rxd5 $3  { Sacrifices the rook to split open my position. My opponent started cheating with a computer after this. I still had a terrible position but it would have been interesting to play this out for real. I thought some of my defensive moves would have posed problems for a player of my strength.}  ( 16. Bf3  {  The computer suggests moves like bf3 here with b4 following. My knights end up getting kicked to the a file or to the back rank.}  ) 16... exd5  { Turning down the sacrifice is impossible really as Rd6 would have followed.}  17. Nxd5  { Attacks the queen. Also threatens a fork on the c7 square so I have limited options as to where I move the queen. e6 is threatened with dual threats of exf7and also white queen attacking c7 with the white queen supporting the knight fork.}  17... Qxe5 $2  { Protects c7 and eliminates the e5 pawn. Comes at the cost of allowing the white queen into f7. I need to be especially careful here as there are lots of knight forking threats. The danger is that my queen and king are on the same open file so Re1 is a major threat now.}  ( 17... Nd4 $3  { Computer recommends giving up the knight with Nd4. I think the difference here is that this move keeps the white queen out. The follow up move Ne6 forces the trade of one of the white knights and helps defuse white's attack.}  18. Nf6+ Kf8 19. Qxd4 Ne6  {  My knight and then my bishop can blockade the e pawn.}  20. Qh4 Nxg5 21. Qxg5 Be6  { In this position black has developed the bishop and the king is moving towards safety in the corner.} ) 18. Qxf7+ Kd8  { only move}  19. f4  { Attacks the queen and supports the knight. Forcing me to make queen moves makes sense here as it is the piece that holds everything together and depending on where I move it I can very easily blunder into a fork or leave a crucial square unguarded.}  19... Be6  { The black queen needs to defend c7 and f6 so I thought the best defense was to attack the white queen instead of moving the black queen.}  20. Nxe6+  { Takes the bishop and checks the king. This keeps the queens on the board.}  ( 20. fxe5  { Taking with the pawn completely dissipates white's attack after the subsequent exchanges.}  20... Bxf7 21. Nxf7+ Kd7 22. Nxh8 Rxh8 ) 20... Qxe6  { Forced}  21. Qc7+  { The black queen has been diverted from defending c7 so the white queen can now make this check.}  21... Ke8  { Forced}  22. Qg7  { Threatens the rook on h8 with the queen. A knight fork on c7 is also threatened which would win my queen.}  22... Ra7  { I tried to save one of the rooks by moving it to a7 where it is protected by the knight.}  ( 22... Qxd5  { I wonder if giving up the two rooks for the knight would have been better here.}  23. Qxh8+ Kf7 24. Qxa8 Qxg2 ) 23. Qxh8+ Kd7 ( 23... Kf7  { Didn't want to play Kf7 because of potential rook sacrifices against the h6 pawn.}  24. Rxh5 gxh5 25. Bxh5+ ) 24. Bf3 Ne7  { Tried to get rid of that d5 knight. It prevents me from making any checks and possibly getting counterplay on e3.}  25. Rd1 Nxd5 26. Rxd5+  { It's all over after this move. Either I get checkmated instantly or lose heavy material and then get checkmated.}  26... Kc7 27. Qd8+  1-0
