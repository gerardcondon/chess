1. e4 e6 { French Defense.}  2. Nf3 { Normally I get d4 here so I'm kind-of out
of book already.}  2... d5 { I decided to play d5 and hope that it would
transpose back into a proper French Defense.}  3. Nc3 { This attacks the d5
pawn. It can transpose into the Nc3 French.}  3... dxe4 { By taking here I'm
transposing into the Rubenstein after Nxe4. This is my default response to the
Nc3 French anyway so I was happy enough to do this.}  4. Nxe4 { What else?
There's no point in not taking the pawn I think. Something like Ne5 would be
met with Nd7.}  4... Be7 { Following my standard Rubenstein response so far. I
played a later game with this line and lost in that. I think if white plays
accurately black's position is not that nice at all as I'm typically forced to
play something like g6.}  5. d4 { Now we're back into a mainline Rubenstein.} 
5... Nf6 { Challenging the knight on e4. Also prepares for castling.}  6. Bd3 {
Standard response - protects the knight on e4, develops a piece and prepares
for castling.}  6... Nxe4 { Book move. My other knight could eventually come to
f6. The bishop on e4 is well placed in that it attacks b7 and makes it hard for
me to develop my c8 bishop. However if my knight comes to f6 it will be
attacked and will have to move somewhere.}  7. Bxe4 Nd7 { Developing my knight.
Threatening to come to f6 while also supporting the push c5.}  8. O-O {
Castles. King is now safe and with the open e-file the rook can come to e1.} 
8... c5 { Attacks the d pawn and gains black some space. This is played in
nearly all French variations. In fact as far as I can see it's a major move in
a lot of black openings - e4 with French and Sicilian and also useful in d4
openings. This was new to me as in school when learning chess we always put a
knight on c6, blocking in this pawn, and leading to stodgy play quite often.}
