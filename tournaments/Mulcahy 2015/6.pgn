1. e4 e6 { French Defense.}  2. Nf3 { Normally I get d4 here so I'm kind-of out
of book already.}  2... d5 { I decided to play d5 and hope that it would
transpose back into a proper French Defense.}  3. Nc3 { This attacks the d5
pawn. It can transpose into the Nc3 French.}  3... dxe4 { By taking here I'm
transposing into the Rubenstein after Nxe4. This is my default response to the
Nc3 French anyway so I was happy enough to do this.}  4. Nxe4 { What else?
There's no point in not taking the pawn I think. Something like Ne5 would be
met with Nd7.}  4... Be7 { Following my standard Rubenstein response so far. I
played a later game with this line and lost in that. I think if white plays
accurately black's position is not that nice at all as I'm typically forced to
play something like g6.}  5. d4 { Now we're back into a mainline Rubenstein.} 
5... Nf6 { Challenging the knight on e4. Also prepares for castling.}  6. Bd3 {
Standard response - protects the knight on e4, develops a piece and prepares
for castling.}  6... Nxe4 { Book move. My other knight could eventually come to
f6. The bishop on e4 is well placed in that it attacks b7 and makes it hard for
me to develop my c8 bishop. However if my knight comes to f6 it will be
attacked and will have to move somewhere.}  7. Bxe4 Nd7 { Developing my knight.
Threatening to come to f6 while also supporting the push c5.}  8. O-O {
Castles. King is now safe and with the open e-file the rook can come to e1.} 
8... c5 { Attacks the d pawn and gains black some space. This is played in
nearly all French variations. In fact as far as I can see it's a major move in
a lot of black openings - e4 with French and Sicilian and also useful in d4
openings. This was new to me as in school when learning chess we always put a
knight on c6, blocking in this pawn, and leading to stodgy play quite often.} 
9. dxc5 { Not sure about taking here. It just brings my knight to c5 and allows
me to swap off his bishop. I think he could have left it and either moved the
light squared bishop somewhere less precarious or play c3. This would have
protected the pawn and created a square on c2 for the bishop. He could also
have just developed with Bf4.}  9... Nxc5 { Taking back with the knight allows
me to win the two bishops. Another option would have been to take with the
bishop and play Nf6. Not sure which would have been better. Losing the knight
causes some problems for kingside defence. But if I kept his bishop on then
developing my queenside would have been an issue}  10. Qe2 { Develops the
queen, protecting the bishop and moving out of the way of a queen trade. Also
this move prepares a rook to come to d1}  10... Nxe4 { Wins the two bishops at
the cost of trading off one of my only developed pieces. I'm accepting a big
loss in development for a possible advantage in the endgame later.}  11. Qxe4 {
Forced. The queen is on a great square here. It inhibits my queenside
development.}  11... O-O { Prudent move to get the King to safety. Without the
light squared bishop, White isn't immediately threatening h7 so I have some
time to develop the rest of my pieces.}  12. Bf4 { Develops his bishop and
connects the rooks. Whites pieces are looking very good here.}  12... Bf6 {
Moving an already developed piece. Maybe I should have tried to develop my
queenside. Is Rb8, b6 and Bb7 too slow though? Also my queen will have to move
somewhere after a rook to d1 so may as well make space in e7. I knew that I
wanted to put that bishop on that diagonal so why not do it now. At least the
kingside is a bit better protected. It also has a threat against b2 so he'll
have to deal with that. Qb6 is a alternative but risky as it moves a piece away
from the kingside where he would have a 3:1 piece advantage.}  13. Be5 { I
don't like this move at all. Why trade the bishop now? It was fine where it
was. I thought he could have dealt with the threats against the b2 pawn by c3
or by Rd1 followed by b3 and c4. However Qa5 or Qb6 are annoying moves. Maybe
if was best to put the knight in the way on e5? I wonder if my queen went to a5
then could he even sacrifice the a pawn and start an attack on the kingside.
Trade my dark squared bishop and do a rook lift on d3.}  ( 13. c3 Qb6 { how do
you defend the b pawn. Don't think you can ignore it and play Bg5 and then put
the knight on g5. You'll create a pawn weakness on the kingside but would like
to do that and still keep the b pawn.}  ) 13... Bxe5 { I traded the bishop and
now he has less pieces to attack my kingside. I can drive the knight back and
if my bishop gets developed then it should be the better minor piece.}  14.
Nxe5 { Taking with the knight makes sense rather than the queen as the queen is
fine on e4. If he took with the queen then I would probably have played bd7 -
can step out of the way of a rook pin and get the bishop to c6.}  ( 14. Qxe5
Bd7 15. Rfd1 Qe7 16. Nd4 Rfd8 ) 14... Qd5 { I cant develop my queenside with
the queen on e4 so I wanted to block that. I don't know if this was any good.
Surely an IQP would be bad for me? I'd have lost most of the minor pieces. I
don't really have a great deal of options here though. Qb6 would block in my
queenside.}  15. Qe3 { White avoided the queen trade. I think he should have
gone for it though. His knight could go f3-d4 and I could never have gotten rid
of it. He would have excellent chances of grabbing my d pawn.}  ( 15. Qxd5 exd5
16. Nf3 Re8 17. Nd4 { the knight dominates the bishop and white will soon take
control of the e file.}  ) 15... f6 { I didn't want to live with the knight in
the centre of the board so I drove it back. I felt this was safe enough as he
lacked a light squared bishop to attack the a2-g8 diagonal. Also now with the
knight gone I could develop my c8 bishop.}  16. Nf3 { Where else. d3 just
blocks in his rook. Wouldn't be doing anything on g4.}  16... e5 { This creates
a route for the queen to go back to f7 or e6. It also opens up potential routes
for the c8 bishop. Now my central pawns are on the other colour to the bishop
so it is not bad anymore. The e pawn is now protected. With this new pawn
structure White can't bring his knight to G5. I don't think I thought much
about alternative moves here. Thus was just a logical consequence of the last
move. I don't think there are any great alternatives. If I put anything on the
d file eg Bd7 or Rd8 then I might get into trouble after my queen is forced to
move by Rd1.}  17. Rfd1 { Obvious move really. Develops the rook and chases
away my queen. Now white has a firm grip on the d file and can't be chased away
from it.}  17... Qf7 { This looks an awkward square to retreat the queen to. I
was worried about Re1 and Nd4 ideas if I put it on e6. It does allow me to
develop my c8 bishop via d7. I wonder if a5 is a better square but then how do
I develop my queenside.}  18. Rd6 { This is the problem with my previous move.
His rook has an entry point deep in my territory. I'll never be able to chase
it away.}  18... Bd7 { Finally developing the light squared bishop}  19. Rad1 {
Completing the doubling of his rooks}  19... Bc6 { Completing the development
of the bishop. It sits well on this diagonal. The main piece that could attack
the bishop here would be the knight but with e5 and d4 out of commission, it
will be hard for white to get a piece around to attack it.}  20. b3 { Starting
to advance his queenside pawns}  20... a6 { This was played so that if a pawn
got to b5, I could recapture and leave my bishop. If he got a second pawn there
then I would be in trouble.}  21. c4 { Gaining space and greatly restricting my
bishop.}  21... Rfe8 { I don't really have a lot of moves here. This puts the
rook opposite his queen. Due to his control of the d file I can't easily put my
rooks in active positions.}  22. Qb6 { I didn't see this move and I was a bit
worried that his pieces could come crashing in. The thing is though I can kind
of ignore it. If he plays Rd8 then I can trade off rooks and my position looks
solid enough.}  22... Qg6 { None of my other pieces can move so I played this
crude threat. I didn't expect him to miss it but you never know. In any case he
would need to deal with the threat and I can probably make active moves with my
queen.}  23. Qe3 { If he played Nh5 then probably Qg5. His move stops the
threat against the knight but it does mean moving the queen backwards. This
eases the pressure on my back rank.}  23... Qe4 { I wonder if I could have
played Qc2 but I guess Rd2 would have stopped that. Or even a4. That would get
the pawns closer to threatening the bishop. This time I offer a queen exchange
but I won't get an IQP.}  24. Qxe4 { He exchanged the queens. I wonder if Qd2
would have been better here. Should he have kept the queens on?}  24... Bxe4 {
Forced recapture.}  25. Rd7 { The rook attacks my pawn. Also the 7th rank is
the best for rooks.}  25... Bc6 { I didn't want him to be able to double on the
7th so this move takes away his entry square there. Also the pawn now protects
my bishop.}  26. R7d6 { Safeguard the rook}  26... Kf7 { I started to
centralise my king for the endgame.}  27. Kf1 { He did the same}  27... Ke7 {
Now I can start to contest the d file. If I trade off rooks I should be better
as a bishop is better than a knight with pawns on both sides of the board.} 
28. Ke2 { Moving his King to the centre.}  28... Rad8 { This starts a trade of
rooks. I couldn't leave him own the d file and what else were my rooks going to
do.}  29. Rxd8 { Starts to trade off rooks. Could he have kept them on? It's
unavoidable if I want to trade. But maybe he could have made a different move
to improve his position and force me to do the trading. That's not possible
with the rook on d6 but if the rook was on d2 or d3 and could be protected by
his King then he would have had a free move here. Maybe instead of going to d6
on move 26 he should have gone back further. Advancing the rook was fine when
his queen was there to prevent my King coming over. Now that the queen is gone,
the rook is attackable on d6.}  29... Rxd8 { Forced recapture.}  30. Rxd8 {
I've started so I'll finish.}  30... Kxd8 { It's annoying that my King has to
do the last recapture on d8 as it will take me a couple of moves to get it back
to the centre.}  31. Ke3 { Centralising the King. After all the trades it's
worth looking at the position. I don't think White has helped himself and if
anyone is slightly better here it should be black. Also White's King is blocked
off from the fourth rank so there's a limit as to how much he can control
Black's King.}  31... Ke7 { Moving my King back to the centre.}  32. g3 { The
knight was pinned to the g pawn so moving this frees up his knight to come into
the game.}  32... Ke6 { My King is well centralised now. With my pawn structure
it can't be easily attacked by the knight.}  33. h4 { I'm not sure what to do
about pawns in these endgames. Should they be kept back or advanced? If they
are advanced then they are more threatening but potentially could also be
attacked. This move stops me playing g5. Should I have been looking to play
that kind of move?}  33... b5 { My thinking here was that I can defend one pawn
with the bishop but two might be tricky. Also rook pawns tend not to be as good
as central pawns so if I can trade my rook pawn for a central pawn that should
be an improvement.}  34. cxb5 { If he doesn't take then I split his pawns. If
he pushes then can I round up that pawn?}  ( 34. c5 b4 35. Nd2 Kd5 36. Ne4 {
The knight is tied to defending the c pawn at the moment. I should be able to
manuevre the bishop somewhere to attack White's other pawns.}  ) 34... axb5 {
Now there is more room for my King and bishop to operate in.}  35. Nh2 { This
move allows me to freeze his queenside pawns with a single pawn of my own, on
my bishops colour. Did he have an alternative though? If he didn't move the
knight and played a3 or b4 could I take the knight and penetrate with my king?}
 ( 35. a3 $1 { this is the key move I think}  35... Bd5 { And now b4 would be
the same win as below.}  ( 35... Bxf3 36. Kxf3 Kd5 37. Ke3 { this way doesn't
work for Black.}  ) 36. a4 { so let's try a4.}  36... Bxb3 ( 36... b4 { This
way I would get to preserve having pawns on both sides of the board but my pawn
can't be defended by my bishop. On the other hand his knight or king would be
tied down to defending b3. Think this is better than trading one of his pawns
for mine.}  37. Nd2 Kd7 { Can any side make progress here?}  38. Nc4 { I don't
think I can take this. The split pawns would freeze my king}  38... Bxc4 39.
bxc4 Kc6 40. Kd3 Kc5 41. Kc2 Kxc4 { or maybe not. This looks ok for me.}  42.
Kb2 Kc5 43. Kb3 { and now I try to create a passed pawn on the kingside}  43...
f5 44. a5 Kb5 45. a6 Kxa6 46. Kxb4 Kb6 47. Kc4 Kc6 48. Kd3 Kd5 { probably
winning for Black}  ) ( 36... bxa4 { this way leaves white with a futher passed
pawn than taking with the bishop but either way I lose having pawns on both
sides of the board.}  37. bxa4 { And what now? If the pawn goes to a5 it can
only be taken with my king so should I move the king to queenside? The bishop
on d5 stops white's king for the moment and his knight will take a few moves to
get into the action.}  37... Kd7 ( 37... Bxf3 { if I take the knight can
white's king come around?}  38. Kxf3 Kd6 39. Ke4 Kc5 40. Kf5 Kb4 41. Ke6 Kxa4
42. Kf7 Kb4 43. Kxg7 Kc4 44. Kxh7 { This is lost for Black so I need to keep
the bishop on the board in this line.}  ) 38. Nd2 Kc6 39. Ne4 Kb6 40. Nc3 Bc6 {
My king is forced over to this side of the board. This has to be good for
white. Even if I win the a pawn, all my pawns are on one side of the board.
That is better for the knight.}  41. f4 exf4+ 42. Kxf4 Kc5 43. a5 Kb4 44. Ne2

Kc4 38. a3 Kb3 39. Kd3 Kxa3 40. Kc3 { Is this winning for Black? I can create a
passed pawn with my kingside majority and when White's king goes to the
kingside, I can take the b pawn and promote my b-pawn.}  40... f5 41. h5 g5 42.
hxg6 hxg6 43. f3 e4 44. fxe4 fxe4 45. Kd4 Kxb4 46. Kxe4 Kc3 { and Black wins} 
) 35... b4 { Now I get to play the Deep Freeze, nulifying his queenside pawn
majority. I had just read about this in my Silman Endgame book beforehand so
this was a stroke of luck, it appearing on the board. Also because my pawn is
so far advanced, he can't play a3 as I can take it and queen my pawn before he
queens his b pawn. If the pawns were moved up one rank then he could push a4
and we would queen at the same time. This has implications for a lot of the
lines that follow as he never had that a pawn option.}  36. g4 { Again I have
no idea if this is good or bad. I can push my f pawn and if he takes then I've
split his pawns. The move stops my King coming to f5.}  36... f5 { If he
doesn't take then I can possibly get a passed central pawn.}  37. f4 { I didn't
see this reply and now it's a bit of a mess. Have to calculate all the capture
and the different orders.}  37... exf4+ { I took here but I wonder if creating
the passed pawn was the better option. It would have been protected by the
bishop.}  ( 37... e4 38. Nf1 fxg4 39. Ng3 { Now though the knight will capture
the e pawn. Not sure if I've improved over the game continuation}  39... Kd5 {
computer move which I never would have played}  40. Nxe4 h5 41. Ng3 Be8 42. Ne2
Bd7 43. Ng3 g6 44. Ne4 Bf5 ) 38. Kxf4 { Forced.}  38... Be4 { I took the chance
to put the bishop on this diagonal. Now it can menace the White pawns. The a
pawn can't advance as Bb1 would grab it.}  39. gxf5+ { Not sure if there were
any alternatives.}  39... Bxf5 { Forced. But now the knight can get back in the
game.}  40. Nf3 { The knight was doing nothing on the edge and had to come to
the centre.}  40... Bb1 { Now the bishop attacks the pawns.}  41. Nd4+ { The
check looks the obvious move to play but I wonder could he protected his pawn
by playing Nd2 instead.}  ( 41. Nd2 Bxa2 { Now if I take, I'm not getting out.
But do I need to}  ( 41... Bf5 { I have to come back but how do I get the win
if I can't get one of those queenside pawns? Don't know that I can.} ) 42. h5 {
computer line}  ( 42. Ke4 h5 { the computer says that this is very good for
Black. So maybe Bxa2 would have been a good practical choice. White would have
had to find h5 on the previous move in order to draw.}  ) 42... Kd5 43. Ke3 g5
44. hxg6 hxg6 45. Kd3 g5 46. Nf3 g4 47. Nd4 Bb1+ 48. Ke3 Bg6 ) 41... Kd5 {
after this the a pawn drops and my bishop gets back out.}  42. Ke3 ( 42. Nf5 {
this isn't an option. Even though his king is over on that side of the board,
he can't take both my pawns. Having them side by side means that he has to come
at them viae6 and f7.}  42... Bxf5 43. Kxf5 Kd4 44. Ke6 { this is interesting.
His king can't take both my pawns as I can push on to h5 and then my king gets
to g4 before he gets to g5.}  ( 44. h5 g6+ 45. hxg6 hxg6+ 46. Kxg6 Kc3 47. Kf5
Kb2 48. Ke4 Kxa2 49. Kd3 Kxb3 { game over. If I had a rook pawn there could
have been drawing chances due to stalemate. However with a knight pawn I had
time to capture both his pawns before his king got over. All I have to do with
a non-rook pawn is get the king in front of it on the 6th rank.}  ) 44... Ke4
45. Kf7 h5 46. Kxg7 Kf5 ) 42... Bxa2 { I grab grab the a pawn. Now I have a
pawn advantage and the b pawn can be attacked.}  43. Nc2 { This attacks my b
pawn. I want to keep the b pawns on as his knight can't cover both sides of the
board at once. If they come off then I don't know that a 2:1 advantage on one
side of the board is convertible for bishop against knight - especially with
his king in front of the pawns.}  43... Kc5 { Defends the b pawn. Bishop takes
was not an option as mentioned.}  44. Nd4 { Defends the pawn and threatens a
fork on e6 against the g pawn.}  44... g6 { Protects the pawn. The h pawn would
be vulnerable if the knight gets to f8 as the bishop can't defend it from where
it is now.}  45. Ne6+ { Possibly heading for f8 with check. Or just gains time
and moves my king away from the b pawn. If Kb4 then Nd5+.}  45... Kd6 { I moved
back here. The knight can't check me on the next move but I don't know if Kd5
wasn't a better move as it would move my King more forward.}  46. Nd4 { Back to
protect the pawn. I don't think trading the b pawn for the h pawn would be that
good for him. It would be hard to get the knight back to stop the b pawn and my
bishop could defend it from the other side of the board while the knight would
be stuck on the queenside.}  46... Bb1 { Brings the bishop back into the game.
Would Kd5 have been better? The knight can't move as the b pawn drops and the
King is tied to the knight's defense. Then I could have a plan of h6, g5 and
create a passed pawn on the kingside.}  47. Nf3 Bf5 48. Kd4 Be6 49. Nd2 Kc6 50.
Ke5 Bg8 51. Kf6 Kc5 52. Kg7 { I was getting nervous now as I lose both my
pawns. I thought I'd messed things up and just hoped I could capture his b3
pawn soon.}  52... Bd5 { only square}  53. Kxh7 { there goes one.}  53... Kd4 {
Now the king gets into position to drive away the knight and allow the bishop
to capture the pawn. Had to be careful of knight checks and forks here. I was
lucky that I lost my first game in the club championship to two knight forks as
I was really on my guard here. If I hadn't lost that game, I'd have lost this
game.}  54. Kxg6 { there goes the other. Now his pawn has a free run down the
board. I was worried that I would have to trade my bishop for it before I won
the b pawn.}  54... Kd3 { Attacks the knight from a position that I can't be
checked.}  ( 54... Kc3 { Why didn't I just go here? Probably afraid of checks
but the check on b1 is harmless. Nc4 is less of a threat now as I can just take
the pawn.}  55. Nb1+ ( 55. Nc4 Kxb3 56. Nd2+ Kc3 57. Nf1 ) 55... Kc2 { I win
the knight here}  ) 55. Nf1 { Now the knight is out of the game and can never
get back into it in time. Black's king blocks the routes to the b pawn. It
would take about five hops to get near the queening square. In knight versus
bishop endgames this is the best scenario for the bishop. It can defend against
threats from a long way off while the knight has limited mobility and can't get
from side to side very easily.}  ( 55. Nc4 { This would have been a better
choice for him in practical terms. I think I might have played something like
Be4+ and then Kc3. He has Na5 which protects the pawn and I can't get to that
knight with the king. If I now trade on b3 then my king blocks my pawn and I
lose a tempo.}  55... Bxc4 { Even if I did find this and counted correctly I
think I would have made a blunder later with my king...}  56. bxc4 b3 57. h5 b2
58. h6 b1=Q 59. h7 Kd4+ { This is the critical move. You have to leave white
with a pawn so that there are no stalemate threats. I definitely didn't know
this at the time of the game and I think I would have played Kxc4 here and
drawn the game.}  ( 59... Kxc4+ { This is a draw. Black's king is too far away
from the h pawn to help the Black queen. White can get in front of the pawn and
Black won't be able to force him away from the pawn and win it.} ) 60. Kg7 Qb7+
61. Kh8 Qf7 62. c5 ) ( 55. h5 { could he have ignored the knight and tried to
push the h pawn?}  55... Kxd2 56. h6 Be4+ { No. Now the bishop will trade
itself for the h pawn and my king will win the b pawn.}  57. Kg7 Kc3 58. h7
Bxh7 59. Kxh7 Kxb3 60. Kg6 Kc2 ) 55... Bxb3 { Takes the pawn and leaves my pawn
free to queen. I was worried that white might be able to queen his pawn also as
my bishop is the wrong colour for that corner. I had to get my bishop to cover
h7 before his pawn got there. His king is on a bad diagonal though and I can
either win time with a check or go to g8 and he has to lose time attacking my
bishop with the king.}  56. Kf5 { The game is lost anyway but this move doesn't
do anything. The king is still on a checking diagonal. It could support the
knight going to e4 but even then the knight is too slow.}  56... Bc2 { Putting
the bishop on the diagonal to stop the pawn and getting out of the way of my
pawn.}  57. Ke5 { The discovered check would win the knight otherwise.}  57...
