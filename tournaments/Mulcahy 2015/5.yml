game: 5.pgn
conclusions:
    - My opponent was the highest rated that I'd played so far so I was happy enough to come out of it with a draw.
    - Looking back over the game there was very little that either player did wrong. I gave black an opening by pushing d5 but then missed an opportunity to play Qh5.
    - I offered a draw in this game. Later I came across the information that Bobby Fisher would never offer draws and that really players who want to improve shouldn't either. Any rating points gain would be meaningless compared to the knowledge gained by playing out an endgame. I didn't realise at this stage how little endgames I'd be able to play during the year - blitz at the club is useless for this. So in future I wanted play out games even if I was going to lose.
errors:
    - positional. undeveloping a bishop form g5 without h6
    - premature attack. Develop pieces to their best positions before attacking.
