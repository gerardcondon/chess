game: 4.pgn
conclusions:
    - most of the time that I thought I was losing, I was only a bit behind. I should be more confident and even if my position is bad I shouldn't get too downhearted.
    - I need to check the range of bishops and queens. When they move check every square of their diagonals. Each move I should check what pieces are on the same files, ranks and diagonals as my king.
    - Overall I was happy enough with the draw as I definitely could have lost the game. However once I got into that pawn up position I should have been more ruthless.
errors:
    - development. Develop the queen to free space for the rooks.
    - weak f7. Be careful moving the f8 rook if f7 is weak.
    - two bishops. Hold on to them if possible.
    - positional. Could be more aggressive. A centralised bishop is better than one on the sidelines.
    - tactics. discovered check. always check all the lines of a bishop - even through other pieces.
    - endgame. remove a pair of rooks if it leaves me with a R vs BB endgame.
    - endgame. drive pawns down the board to create threats. Also stops the opponent creating a block with a piece on your territory.
