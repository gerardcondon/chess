{ This was my second game in the Mulcahy tournament. I'd played my opponent many
times before in blitz and hadn't had too much success against him. Going by his
rating though I would expect to play a decent game against him. } 1. e4 c5 2.
c3 { This is my standard response to the Sicilian. The idea is to play
something that doesn't require memorizing loads of theory.}  2... e6 { I don't
think I'd ever seen this response before. Normally people play a knight move or
d4.}  3. d4 { The logical follow up to c3.}  3... d5 { After this move I
realised that we'd somehow stumbled into a French style game. I could go into
an advance by playing e5.}  4. exd5 { I never play the advance so I took on d5.
If black plays Qxd5 then we transpose to the normal c3 sicilian lines.}  4...
Qxd5 5. Nf3 { Standard developing move. Nc6 is coming which will attack d4.} 
5... Nf6 6. Be2 { Developing and preparing to castle.}  6... Nc6 7. O-O {
Getting my king to safety.}  7... Be7 8. h3 { I want to play the bishop to e3.
Black can then play Ng4 attacking it. I know you're not supposed to play pawn
moves in front of the king but otherwise I don't know how to deal with Ng4.} 
8... b6 { Preparing to fianchetto the bishop. I was worried here that I would
get mated on the long diagonal! Once his bishop goes on b7 then my knight is
effectively pinned on f3.}  9. Be3 { Developing the bishop, defending d4 and
also attacking the pawn on c5.}  9... Bb7 { Completing the fianchetto.}  10. c4
{ Drives back the queen and creates space on c3 for a knight. My plan was to
try and capture on c5, splitting his pawns. I'm not sure that c4 really worked
out for me in the end. This pawn was too vulnerable and he was able to get
counterplay with his bishop on f6.}  ( 10. dxc5 bxc5 ( 10... Bxc5 11. Qxd5 Nxd5
12. Bxc5 bxc5 13. Nbd2 ) 11. Nbd2 { I think here my position is more secure
than with the pawn on c4. If instead he took on c5 with the bishop then I would
change queens and then take the bishop to get a similar position.}  ) 10... Qd7
{ Probably the best place for the queen. No point to go back to d8 as it would
block the rook coming to the open file.}  11. dxc5 bxc5 12. Nc3 { Developing
the knight. From here the knight can go to b5 and c6. I didn't see this during
the game however - my opponent pointed it out to me after the game. Even worse
was that I was worried that his knight could come to b4 but completely missed
similar moves for me.}  12... O-O $2 $155 { Get the king to safety and develop
his rook.}  ( { the computer thinks that castling straightaway was an error and
that black should have moved the queen to safety before castling. } 12... Qc7
13. Qc2 O-O ) 13. Qxd7 $2 $155 { Here I exchanged queens. I'm not too sure why
I did this. Maybe I thought that the position would be less dangerous for me
without the queens. I didn't have much knowledge of what my chess level
actually was so I wasn't sure how aggressive I should be in the game. Looking
at it now I wonder if it was better to keep the queens on and improve my
position. Maybe b3 to protect the c pawn and then something with the c3 knight
e.g. Nb5.}  ( 13. b3 { Lucky I didn't play b3. The computer says that this is
an even worse move than Qxd7. It allows Nb5.} ) ( 13. Na4 { Computer
recommendation is to play Na4 which picks up the c-pawn}  13... Rfd8 14. Nxc5 )
13... Nxd7 { Forced}  14. Rfd1 { Developing my rook. I'm never quite sure which
rook to develop first. I wonder if it was better to develop the a rook to d1.
Rooks on f1 are doing something already so it would be better to develop the
other rook first.}  14... Rfd8 { Bringing his rook to the open file. Again
maybe the a rook was the one to develop here.}  15. Rd2 { Preparing to double
my rooks. I saw that he couldn't double his with the knight on d7 so I wanted
to claim the open file for myself.}  15... Rac8 $2 { I didn't think that this
was a good move. The rook isn't doing much more on c8 than it was doing on a8.
I think a better plan was to move the d7 knight somewhere, trade off a pair of
rooks and then develop the a rook to the d file.}  ( 15... e5 { The computer
disagrees with me though. Gives this line as best which allows black to plant a
knight on d4.}  16. Rad1 Nd4 ) 16. Rad1 { Completing doubling my rooks. They're
fairly powerful on the open d file. His knight is under threat now and needs to
move.}  16... Nde5 { Attacks my pawn on c4 and the knight on f3. This is a good
square for this knight as I can't easily kick it way with a pawn and it is
defended by the knight on c6.}  ( 16... Nb6 { This is the computer's
reccommendation. It prevents Na4 from me and so holds on to the pawn.} ) 17.
Nxe5 { I saw that I win a pawn at the end of this sequence. In hindsight the
fact that I gave up the two bishops proved to be a major disadvantage. I didn't
see the Bf6 move so I thought that I would just win a pawn and keep the minor
pieces on the board.}  ( 17. b3 Ng6 18. Rxd8+ Rxd8 19. Rxd8+ Nxd8 { If I try to
protect the c pawn then I don't get to win his pawn. His knight needed to be
moved from c6 so that it can't recapture on d8.}  ) ( 17. Rxd8+ { Taking with
the rook first was a much better sequence.}  17... Rxd8 18. Rxd8+ Bxd8 19. Nxe5
Nxe5 20. Bxc5 ) 17... Nxe5 { Forced. He could swap a pair of rooks first but
would end up in a similar positon.}  18. Rxd8+ Bxd8 ( 18... Rxd8 { Taking with
the rook is worse for him I think. He was able to get his rook really active.} 
19. Rxd8+ Bxd8 20. Bxc5 Bf6 ) 19. Bxc5 { The bishop can't be taken due to the
threat of mate on d8.}  ( 19. b3 Bf6 20. Nb5 ) 19... Bf6 { I didn't see this
move. He xray attacks my knight on c3 so if I push b3 to defend the c pawn then
my c3 knight is loose and can be subject to discovered attacks after his knight
moves.}  20. Bxa7 $2 { I thought that he was going to take the c pawn so I
wanted to remain a pawn ahead. However this moves leads to me losing my dark
squared bishop and in the end threw away my winning chances. The computer says
Bd4 is a better move}  ( 20. Bd4 Nxc4 21. Bxf6 gxf6 22. Rd7 Bc6 23. Rxa7 Nxb2
24. Bh5 Kh8 25. Bxf7 Bxg2 26. Kxg2 Rxc3 27. Bxe6 { This would have been a much
better position for me. Outside passed pawn and better minor piece.}  ) ( 20.
b4 { This doesn't work due to the bishop on f6.}  20... Nxc4 21. Bxc4 Bxc3 22.
Rc1 Bxb4 23. Bxb4 Bd5 ) ( 20. Na4 { This doesn't work due to Bc6.}  20... Bc6
21. b3 Bxa4 22. bxa4 Rxc5 ) 20... Nxc4 { takes my pawn and threatens the b
pawn. I can't move the b pawn due to Bxc3.}  21. Bxc4 { Forced as it's the only
way to keep my b pawn.}  21... Rxc4 { I'm a pawn up after this but he has two
bishops on an open board. The immediate threat is to win back his pawn with
Bxc3, bxc3 Rxc3.}  22. Be3 { Bringing my bishop back from a7. Now it's
protected again and fairly central. It can go to d2 to protect the knight.} 
22... h6 { He can't take on c3 immediately due to the back rank mate threat so
he needs to give his king luft.}  23. Bd2 { This protects the knight on c3 but
at the cost of making my pieces really passive. I never really got the
queenside pawns moving as I was always tied up protecting my pieces.}  23...
Ba8 $2 { This was a bad move. The bishop is doing nothing here and in some
lines is vulnerable to a check by my rook on d8.}  24. Be1 { Still protecting
the knight but trying to give my rook some activity. Now at least it has a
clear view of the d file.}  24... Bc6 { Realising that the last move was bad
and undoing the damage.}  25. a3 { Not too sure what I was doing here. Think I
was preparing to move b4.}  ( 25. b3 { My opponent suggested this move after
the game. I didn't realise that the knight can't be taken due to tactical
reasons. If I had seen that then I think I would have made this move.}  25...
Rxc3 ( 25... Bxc3 26. bxc4 { Can't take with the bishop as I pick up the
exchange.}  ) ( 25... Rc5 { I think this would be the best response.}  26. b4 {
this doesn't do much after Rc4 so I think instead that I should take the
opportunity to reroute my knight somwhere.}  ( 26. Ne2) 26... Rc4 ) 26. Bxc3
Bxc3 27. Rc1 { Can't take with the rook as in this position I can win a bishop
back. This is a good pattern to know - two bishops on the same rank or file
can't defend each other from a rook.}  ) 25... Kf8 { Starting to bring his king
into the game.}  26. Rd6 { This was a waste of a move. I completely missed that
he can just play Ke7. Not sure what I was thinking here.}  ( 26. Rd3 { This
would have been a better rook move.} ) 26... Ke7 27. Rd1 { This is too passive.
Think I should have gone back to d3.}  27... Rd4 { Offering a trade of rooks.
If I turn it down then he has taken the d file.}  28. Rxd4 { Don't think I
really had any alternatives.}  28... Bxd4 { His bishops are very powerful now.
Much better than my minor pieces.}  29. b4 { Starting to push my queenside
pawns. Also frees up the knight so that it could move somewhere  (  although it
never did  )}  29... Kd6 { Sensible move centralising the king. He is far
closer to the queenside pawns than my king.}  30. Kf1 { Trying to activate my
king. However I think I should have moved the knight. After he takes the knight
it becomes a bishops of opposite colour ending which are very drawish. However
even if I move my knight e.g. to d1 then he has Bc4. To be honest at this stage
I was more than happy with the draw. I knew I couldn't lose from here.}  30...
g6 { This advance means that the g pawn is protected and on the other colour to
my bishop. However the h pawn is now unprotected.}  31. f3 { This frees up my
king as the g pawn is now defended.}  31... Bxc3 { Now we have a bishops of
opposite colour ending. Probably a draw given his active king.}  32. Bxc3 {
Forced.}  32... Kd5 { Centralising the king. He's basically immune on the white
squares.}  33. Ke1 { Not sure why I played this instead of Ke2}  33... Kc4 { I
don't think I can save the a pawn here. His king can go to b3. I could put my
bishop on c1 but it would be stuck there. He could move his king to c2 and
force a repetition - my bishop would have to move away and then back to c1 once
the king goes to b3.}  34. Bd2 { My idea is to trade the h pawn for the a pawn.
If white protects the h pawn by playing h5 then I would move my bishop to c1.} 
34... Kb3 ( 34... h5 35. Bc1 Kb3 36. Kd2 Bb5 37. h4 { This may be more
promising for me. My king could head to the kingside and I could possibly
maintain one of the queenside pawns.}  ) 35. Bxh6 Kxa3 36. Bf8 Kb3 37. Kf2 {
this is where my previous Ke1 move really hurt me. If I had played Ke2 then I
could get to the third rank now. As it is, in the game his king dominated
mine.}  37... Kc4 38. Ke3 ( 38. Kg3 Kd3 39. Kg4 Ke2 { not sure if this was much
better. Probably the kingside pawns get exchanged with each other and I can
never drive the b pawn through.}  ) 38... e5 { Now my king is stuck on the
third rank}  39. h4 f5 40. g4 { Don't think that this was a good move. I didn't
see that he could play f4 and my king would be useless.}  40... f4+ 41. Kf2 {
My king is stuck defending this pawn on f3. If I try to bring my king up via
the h file then his king can capture the f pawn.}  41... Be8 { Now that his
bishop is on e8 I can't play h5 and create a passed pawn. I can't create one
with g5 and then h5 as his bishop will capture it as soon as it goes to g6.} 
42. Ke2 { My opponent offered a draw around here. I played on for a few moves
but it was obvious that I couldn't make progress.}  42... Kc3 43. Bd6 Kd4 44.
Kf2 Kd5 45. Bf8 Kd4  1/2-1/2
