game: 2.yml
conclusions:
    - Two bishops against bishop and knight on open board can be lethal. The unopposed bishop is really strong.
    - Opposite-colour bishop endings are drawish.
    - Watch out for king mobility in the endgame - can get blocked by pawns.
errors:
    - Tactics. Missed knight manouevre.
    - Positional. Gave opponent two bishops on an open board
