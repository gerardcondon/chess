1. d4 { My first time playing against d4.}  1... d5 { My non-e4 system which I
play against d4, c4, g3, Nf3. The first five moves are the same all the time -
d5, e6, Nf6, Be7 and 0-0.}  2. Bf4 { The London system. Had never seen this
before so assumed it was alright to play my standard d4 setup.}  2... e6 3. Nf3
Nf6 { This all looks fine to me}  4. e3 Be7 { Again still looks fine. I was
wondering should I try to remove the bishop with something like Nh5. In blitz
games with a bishop on f4 I sometimes get hit with the b1 knight making its way
to b5 and then I'm in trouble.}  5. Bd3 { A good move placing the bishop on a
strong diagonal. Black has no way to threaten this bishop at the moment.}  5...
O-O { Still assume that this is ok but in the game I came under a strong
kingside attack. Still with the bishop on f4 I don't think I could even
consider long castling.}  6. h3 { Don't think this was a good move. I wasn't
really planning Ng4 as there is nothing to attack on e3 and my bishop can't
come to g4. I think white would have been better off developing another piece
or castling.}  6... b6 { My standard setup  (  from Purdy's Action chess book 
)  calls for b6 and probably Bb7. Think this is fine as it can support me
playing c5.}  7. O-O Nbd7 { I normally play this move in d4 openings. Don't
think it would have done much on c6 as the d4 pawn is protected by e3.}  8.
Nbd2 { Developing white's last minor piece}  8... c5 { This seems to be a
standard freeing move in lots of openings for black so I assumed it would be
fine here.}  9. c3 { Protecting the d4 pawn and creating a square for the queen
to come to c7 or the bishop to drop back to c7.}  9... Bb7 { Completing the
fianchetto. Putting the bishop here can allow me to play a knight to e4 in some
lines as the pawn would be protected by the bishop if the knight is taken.} 
10. Rc1 { Bringing the rook to what I assumed would be the soon to be opened
c-file.}  10... Rc8 { Same from black.}  11. Re1 { Developing the rook to e1.
If the e-file is opened then this rook will support any pieces on the e-file.} 
( 11. Qa4 { This move looks strong as it attacks the a pawn. If I have to push
it to a5 then b5 would be forever weak. Would I have to play the rook back to
a8?} ) 11... cxd4 $6 { I took here and I'm not really sure why. I didn't see
myself as having too many other moves. I get to this kind of position in d-pawn
openings where everything is more or less developed and I'm never sure what to
do next.}  ( 11... Ne4 { this would have been a better move.} ) 12. exd4 { I
assumed that white would take back with the c-pawn. It came as a bit of a shock
instead that they took back with the e-pawn. Suddenly I had visions of whites
pieces crashing through on the kingside and I not being able to do much to stop
them. My light squared bishop is pretty much out of commission on b7 against a
kingside attack.}  12... Re8 { Developing my rook to the e-file. Not sure what
it's doing here but it wasn't doing much on f8 either. It may even be worse
here as the knight could potentially get pinned to the rook.}  13. Ne5 { This
is a very strong piece on e5. It attacks several squares in my camp. Also I
have to be wary of putting anything on the b8-h2 diagonal as it could be
subject to a discovered attack.}  13... a6 { I wasn't sure if I should trade
off the knight on e5. I didn't see the position as being any better for me if I
did because whatever came to e5 would be fairly safe there from attack. Also if
white trades off my knight on d7 then my queen getds developed for free. Once I
decided not to trade, I played a6 to stop any Bb5 ideas.}  14. Ndf3 { This
seems to be very logical move but after the game we discussed this and I
wondered if the knight was doing a better job on d2 as it was stopping my
knight coming to e4. In the game once my knight was planted on e4 it was a bit
of a thorn in white's side as it blocked communication between the
light-squared bishop and the kingside.}  ( 14. Re3 { Maybe something like this
with the intention of Qe2 and Re1. I don't have anything that can attack e3 so
I think this would be safe enough.} ) 14... Ne4 { I played this move to try to
block out the light squared bishop. Also my position is fairly cramped and if I
can follow this up with Ndf6 and Bd6 it would be much improved. There is the
possibility of f6 to kick away the knight but I wouldn't want to play that now
as the e-pawn would be very weak}  15. Nxd7 { White takes the opportunity to
remove my knight and plant their remaining knight on e5.}  15... Qxd7 { My
queen gets temporarily developed to d7 before getting kicked away again.}  16.
Ne5 { Attacks the queen. This knight is well placed and I constantly have to
calculate are tehre any knight forks available.}  16... Qd8 { Only square for
the queen.}  17. Qf3 { Brings the queen to an active square. I was worried now
about f7.}  ( 17. Qh5 { would this have been better? I don't really want to
play g6 and now f3 is a serious threat as my knight is pinned against the mate
on h7.}  17... g6 { Nf6 is what I would want to play but can't due to Qxf7+.
Now h6 is very weak and there are threats of Qh6, Bh6, Ng4 eyeing up h6 and f6.
I think I would have tried to get my bishop to f7 but my queen hasn't too many
squares available against Bg5 ideas.}  ) 17... Rf8 { played the rook back to
defend the f7 pawn.}  18. Bh2 { Brings the bishop out of the way of the queen
on the f-file while still keeping it protected. Not too sure about this move
though as it lessens the threat along the c1-h6 diagonal. This is why I would
have preferred Qh5 in the previous move for white as the bishop didn't need to
be moved.}  18... Bd6 { My idea here was to set up a battery against the bishop
on h2. Then I could play f6 as the knight would be pinned. Didn't see at this
time that the knight would just move back to g4. Still I thought I would at
least force some pieces off the board and lessen the danger to my king.}  19.
a3 { not too sure why this move was played. It does prevent any Bb4 ideas after
a c4 push. I don't really understand queenside pawn moves so all this stuff is
opaque to me.}  19... b5 { this grabs some space, prevents c4  (  which I'm not
sure is a threat anyway?  )  and restricts white's light squared bishop on the
queenside. My bishop on b7 is fairly bad at the moment. It does give the c5
square to white's knight but that knight was never going to transfer over there
anyway.}  20. Re3 $2 { this rook lift prepares to double along the e-file. The
queen blocks it coming to f3 though.  the computer thinks that this is a bad
move. I think because if blocks the e3 square for the knight after f6, Ng4}  (
20. Qg4 { the computer gives this move for white} ) 20... Qc7 { Setting up that
battery.  This was a blunder. I could have trapped the knight for a couple of
pawns after f6.}  ( 20... f6 21. Ng4 h5 22. Bxd6 hxg4 23. Qf4 Nxd6 24. Rxe6 Ne4
25. Qxg4 Rc7 26. f3 Ng5 27. Re2 ) 21. Rce1 { Completing doubling the rooks but
they don't really have a target on the e-file. I wondered was there any stage
when white shuld have taken the knight on e4 with the bishop. Could I have hung
onto that e4 pawn then?}  21... f6 { booting the knight away. It's a pity it
could go to g4. Even after recapturing on h2 however it would be a long way
from the action and would need a couple of moves to get back in position.}  22.
Ng4 Bxh2+ { Not sure if this was a good trade but I thought I should trade
pieces as I had less space. Also once this piece was gone I started to relax as
I thought I'd weathered the storm. I didn't see a checkmate for white after
this.}  23. Nxh2 { Now this knight has gone from e5 to h2 and my knight on e4
is looking the best minor piece.}  23... Rf7 $2 { doubling the rooks. Is this
good or bad? I don't know but at least it's a plan! I think I was planning to
follow up with pushing the e and f pawns.  again according to the computer this
is a mistake and white should win the black knight here after Qh5 and f3}  (
23... e5 { best move according to the computer}  24. Qh5 exd4 25. cxd4 { and
now the threat is f3. I don't see myself as having come up with a good solution
if this was played in the game.}  25... g6 { and my king is starting to look a
bit loose}  ) 24. Bxe4 $2 { Now white takes the knight. I get doubled e-pawns
but it's hard for white to take the pawn as it's protected by the bishop on b7.
And if that pawn advances or gets traded then that b7 bishop becomes a lot
stronger.}  ( { the computer says that Bxe4 is a mistake and that Qh5 is very
strong. in the game it probably would have won the knight. } 24. Qh5 g6 25. Qh6
Rcf8 { if I had continued with my plan}  26. f3 Ng5 27. h4 { and now the rook
on f7 is blocking a retreat square of the knight}  ) 24... dxe4 { forced}  25.
Qd1 { maybe Qh5 was a more aggressive option. From d1 though the queen can get
to the queenside.}  25... f5 { shoring up the e pawn. I was starting to think
at this stage of f4, e3 pushing back white's rooks.}  26. f4 $4 { this just
loses a pawn. At first I was wondering whether to take en-passant or not as i
didn't see that the pawn was undefended. I was only when I calculated Qcf4 that
I realised that white loses a pawn.}  ( 26. Nf1 { Would have played something
like this to bring the knight back into the game. The kingside looks solid
enough now so would aim to bring him to the c5 square via d2 and b3. Would have
been a monster if it got to there. Think I would have to play Bd5 to trade if
it ever got to b3.} ) 26... Qxf4 { This makes it really hard for white now as I
have a protected passed pawn. Now f4 and e3 are real threats and those moves
would also open up the bishop on b7 - g2 would come under pressure.}  27. Qb3 {
Attacking the e6 pawn.}  27... Bd5 { Defending the pawn and attacking the
queen. This is a good square for the bishop and I would probably have moved it
here at some stage.}  28. Qb4 $155 { Moving the queen out of the way. It's
running out of squares. I didn't see so at the time but I wonder if there's
anything from Rc4, Qe6 and then Ra4?  The computer says that the Rc4 lines have
about the same evaluation as the line I played.}  28... Qc7 { Retreated the
queen here. I needed to get it off f4 and I thought from here it would support
f4 advance and link up with my rooks.}  ( 28... Rc4 29. Qa5 Qd6 30. b3 Rc8 31.
Qb4 ( 31. Rb1 { white's pieces aren't co-ordinated and I could start to push f4
and e3 here.}  31... f4 32. Re2 f3 33. gxf3 exf3 34. Re5 f2+ 35. Kf1 Rcf8 36.
Ng4 Qc6 { looks dangerous for white now. Their king is very exposed.}  ) 31...
Qxb4 32. cxb4 Rfc7 33. Nf1 Rc2 34. R1e2 Rxe2 35. Rxe2 Bxb3 ) 29. Nf1 { Now
bringing the knight back into the game. Has to go this circuitous route as f3
and g4 are unavailable}  29... Rcf8 $2 { I didn't know whether to just push f4
and e3 now. I played this to make sure that when I played f4 it was well
supported but I don't know if I could have played it anyway.}  ( { computer
says I should have gone for f4 } 29... f4 30. Rxe4 ( 30. R3e2 e3 31. Nh2 f3 32.
Nxf3 Qg3 33. Rf1 Bxf3 34. Rxf3 Rxf3 ) 30... Bxe4 ( { apparently I should have
declined the exchange sac - would never have seen that over the board } 30...
f3 31. gxf3 Rxf3 32. Rg4 Rxh3 33. Rg2 ) 31. Rxe4 { not sure how I would have
reacted if white tried this exchange sacrifice. suddenly my pawns are looking a
bit weak and white has a mass of queenside pawns and a knight to come into the
game.}  ) 30. a4 { white can create a passed pawn on the queenside and that
looks to be their best plan.  apparently this move is a -2 blunder. f4 is the
way to punish it}  30... Bc4 $4 { I miscalculated here. I played this move to
take away the e2 square from the rook after I play f4. However I didn't see
until I had made the move that this bishop protects the e4 square so now f4 is
impossible.}  ( 30... f4 31. R3e2 f3 32. Rf2 fxg2 33. Rxg2 e3 ) 31. b3 {
attacking the bishop and driving it back. Now it can't protect the b5 pawn. 
the computer considers this move a mistake as it allows f4 but in a game I
would never consider that while the bishop is under attack.}  31... Bd5 $2 { I
didn't consider Bxf1 as an option here. The bishop is a better piece at the
moment  computer says I should have played f4. It's a constant theme - I was
too reluctant to play it. Still I didn't play any move that was obviously
losing and I always kept my winning advantage.}  32. axb5 axb5 { I was worried
that I would be losing a pawn here put I think Rb8 regains it.}  33. c4 $2 {
this loses another pawn}  ( 33. Qxb5 Rb8 34. Qa6 Rxb3 { and now it is white's c
pawn which is a little weak.}  ) 33... bxc4 34. bxc4 Qxc4 { I wanted to get the
queens off so I recaptured with the queen here. This is now threatening the d4
pawn.}  35. Qxc4 { After the queen trade I was happy enough with my position. I
had a target with the d4 pawn and still had the f4, e3 advances to come.}  (
35. Qb6 Rb7 36. Qc5 Rc8 { If white avoided the immediate queen trade I don't
think they could have held onto the d pawn in the long term.}  ) 35... Bxc4 36.
Nd2 { Now the knight is getting back in the game but it doesn't have any good
outposts that it can get to. It can't get to e5 and the white bishop on d3
would dominate it.}  36... Bd3 { Now f4 would win the exchange.}  37. Rc1 {
Have to get the rooks active.}  ( { computer gives Nf3. I can't take it as the
bishop would hang. } 37. Nf3 f4 38. Rxe4 Bxe4 39. Rxe4 Rf6 40. Ne5 { Still
winning for black but would have been tricky}  40... Ra8 41. Nd7 Ra1+ 42. Kf2

d-pawn. I was willing to trade on of the e-pawns for it. I thought that without
this pawn white will find it very hard to queen a pawn.}  38. Nb3 { Defending
the d pawn.}  38... Rb8 { Attacking the knight. If it moved  (  e.g. to c5  ) 
then I was going to take the d pawn and let it take the e6 pawn. White can't
defend it with Rb8 as the bishop guards that square. And Rc3 doesn't look very
sustainable - white's pieces would be very tied down.}  ( { Kf7 here was better
according to the computer. Protects the e6 pawn and starts to centralise the
king. } 38... Kf7 39. Rc6 Re8 40. Kf2 f4 41. Re1 g5 42. Rec1 h5 ) 39. Nc5 ( 39.
Rc3 Rb4 { I think I could manoevre my pieces to attack d4 here. Rook to d8 and
then b8 maybe.}  ) 39... Rxd4 { Eliminating white's central pawn.}  40. Nxe6 {
Taking my e6 pawn and attacking the rook.}  40... Rc4 { I wanted to trade down
pieces as the pawn endgame would be winning for black. After this black can't
avoid the trade of one of the pairs of rooks.}  41. Rxc4 { If white didn't take
then Rb1+ would be coming}  41... Bxc4 42. Nd4 { Centralising the knight and
attacking f5}  42... g6 { Defending the f5 pawn. This pawn chain is very
strong. White can't reall get to the base of it.}  43. Kh2 { The king ends up
getting boxed in here. Should have played Kf2 instead.}  ( { computer says Kf2
is equally bad. } 43. Kf2 Rb2+ 44. Kg3 Bf1 ) 43... Bd3 { Protecting the bishop.
After my previous games I was worried about a knight fork.}  ( 43... Rd8 {
apparently I should have played Rd8}  44. Nc6 Rd2 45. Ne5 { it would allow my
rook to come to the second rank}  ) 44. Nc6 { Attacks the rook. Maybe the
knight was better on d4.}  44... Rb1 { Now f4 is very strong as the rook has
nowhere to go.}  45. Ne5 { Attacks the bishop}  45... f4 { I win the exchange
here and still remain a pawn up}  46. Nxd3 $4 { I don't know if this was the
right recapture. Black a still has four pawns and the knight can't hold
everything together.}  ( 46. Rxd3 exd3 47. Nxd3 g5 { I think this would have
been the better shot. My central passed pawn is gone and it may be difficult to
create another one. White's king is in front of the pawns and removing any
width from the position favours the knight.}  48. Ne5 Kg7 49. Nf3 h6 { could
white have created a fortress here?}  50. Ne5 Kf6 51. Nf3 Kf5 52. Nd4+ Ke4 {
doesn't look likely as my king can come up the board. once it gets to the 3rd
rank then there will be cases where I can exchange the rook for the knight and
win.}  ) 46... fxe3 47. Nf4 { Now the postion is lost. White's knight has to
defend the pawns as it can be driven away by the rook. Capturing the other way,
white's g-pawn would have stopped the black pawns' advances.}  47... g5 48. Ne2
Rb2 49. Nd4 e2 50. Nxe2 Rxe2 51. Kg3 { White's king can't move and black is a
rook and a pawn up.}  51... h6  0-1
