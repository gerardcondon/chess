1. d4 { My first time playing against d4.}  1... d5 { My non-e4 system which I
play against d4, c4, g3, Nf3. The first five moves are the same all the time -
d5, e6, Nf6, Be7 and 0-0.}  2. Bf4 { The London system. Had never seen this
before so assumed it was alright to play my standard d4 setup.}  2... e6 3. Nf3
Nf6 { This all looks fine to me}  4. e3 Be7 { Again still looks fine. I was
wondering should I try to remove the bishop with something like Nh5. In blitz
games with a bishop on f4 I sometimes get hit with the b1 knight making its way
to b5 and then I'm in trouble.}  5. Bd3 { A good move placing the bishop on a
strong diagonal. Black has no way to threaten this bishop at the moment.}  5...
O-O { Still assume that this is ok but in the game I came under a strong
kingside attack. Still with the bishop on f4 I don't think I could even
consider long castling.}  6. h3 { Don't think this was a good move. I wasn't
really planning Ng4 as there is nothing to attack on e3 and my bishop can't
come to g4. I think white would have been better off developing another piece
or castling.}  6... b6 { My standard setup (from Purdy's Action chess book)
calls for b6 and probably Bb7. Think this is fine as it can support me playing
c5.}  7. O-O Nbd7 { I normally play this move in d4 openings. Don't think it
would have done much on c6 as the d4 pawn is protected by e3.}  8. Nbd2 {
Developing white's last minor piece}  8... c5 { This seems to be a standard
freeing move in lots of openings for black so I assumed it would be fine here.}
 9. c3 { Protecting the d4 pawn and creating a square for the queen to come to
c7 or the bishop to drop back to c7.}  9... Bb7 { Completing the fianchetto.
Putting the bishop here can allow me to play a knight to e4 in some lines as
the pawn would be protected by the bishop if the knight is taken.}  10. Rc1 {
Bringing the rook to what I assumed would be the soon to be opened c-file.} 
10... Rc8 { Same from black.}  11. Re1 { Developing the rook to e1. If the
e-file is opened then this rook will support any pieces on the e-file.}  ( 11.
Qa4 { This move looks strong as it attacks the a pawn. If I have to push it to
a5 then b5 would be forever weak. Would I have to play the rook back to a8?} )
11... cxd4 { I took here and I'm not really sure why. I didn't see myself as
having too many other moves. I get to this kind of position in d-pawn openings
where everything is more or less developed and I'm never sure what to do next.}
 12. exd4 { I assumed that white would take back with the c-pawn. It came as a
bit of a shock instead that they took back with the e-pawn. Suddenly I had
visions of whites pieces crashing through on the kingside and I not being able
to do much to stop them. My light squared bishop is pretty much out of
commission on b7 against a kingside attack.}  12... Re8 { Developing my rook to
the e-file. Not sure what it's doing here but it wasn't doing much on f8
either. It may even be worse here as the knight could potentially get pinned to
the rook.}  13. Ne5 { This is a very strong piece on e5. It attacks several
squares in my camp. Also I have to be wary of putting anything on the b8-h2
diagonal as it could be subject to a discovered attack.}  13... a6 { I wasn't
sure if I should trade off the knight on e5. I didn't see the position as being
any better for me if I did because whatever came to e5 would be fairly safe
there from attack. Also if white trades off my knight on d7 then my queen getds
developed for free.

Once I decided not to trade, I played a6 to stop any Bb5
ideas.}  14. Ndf3 { This seems to be very logical move but after the game we
discussed this and I wondered if the knight was doing a better job on d2 as it
was stopping my knight coming to e4. In the game once my knight was planted on
e4 it was a bit of a thorn in white's side as it blocked communication between
the light-squared bishop and the kingside.}  ( 14. Re3 { Maybe something like
this with the intention of Qe2 and Re1. I don't have anything that can attack
e3 so I think this would be safe enough.} ) 14... Ne4 { I played this move to
try to block out the light squared bishop. Also my position is fairly cramped
and if I can follow this up with Ndf6 and Bd6 it would be much improved. There
is the possibility of f6 to kick away the knight but I wouldn't want to play
that now as the e-pawn would be very weak}  15. Nxd7 { White takes the
opportunity to remove my knight and plant their remaining knight on e5.}  15...
Qxd7 { My queen gets temporarily developed to d7 before getting kicked away
again.}  16. Ne5 { Attacks the queen. This knight is well placed and I
constantly have to calculate are tehre any knight forks available.}  16... Qd8
{ Only square for the queen.}  17. Qf3 { Brings the queen to an active square.
I was worried now about f7.}  ( 17. Qh5 { would this have been better? I don't
really want to play g6 and now f3 is a serious threat as my knight is pinned
against the mate on h7.}  17... g6 { Nf6 is what I would want to play but can't
due to Qxf7+. Now h6 is very weak and there are threats of Qh6, Bh6, Ng4 eyeing
up h6 and f6. I think I would have tried to get my bishop to f7 but my queen
hasn't too many squares available against Bg5 ideas.}  ) 17... Rf8 { played the
rook back to defend the f7 pawn.}  18. Bh2 { Brings the bishop out of the way
of the queen on the f-file while still keeping it protected. Not too sure about
this move though as it lessens the threat along the c1-h6 diagonal. This is why
I would have preferred Qh5 in the previous move for white as the bishop didn't
need to be moved.}  18... Bd6 { My idea here was to set up a battery against
the bishop on h2. Then I could play f6 as the knight would be pinned. Didn't
see at this time that the knight would just move back to g4. Still I thought I
would at least force some pieces off the board and lessen the danger to my
king.}  19. a3 { not too sure why this move was played. It does prevent any Bb4
ideas after a c4 push. I don't really understand queenside pawn moves so all
this stuff is opaque to me.}  19... b5 { this grabs some space, prevents c4
(which I'm not sure is a threat anyway?) and restricts white's light squared
bishop on the queenside. My bishop on b7 is fairly bad at the moment. It does
give the c5 square to white's knight but that knight was never going to
transfer over there anyway.}  20. Re3 { this rook lift prepares to double along
the e-file. The queen blocks it coming to f3 though.}  20... Qc7 { Setting up
that battery.}  21. Rce1 { Completing doubling the rooks but they don't really
have a target on the e-file. I wondered was there any stage when white shuld
have taken the knight on e4 with the bishop. Could I have hung onto that e4
pawn then?}  21... f6 { booting the knight away. It's a pity it could go to g4.
Even after recapturing on  h2 however it would be a long way from the action
and would need a couple of moves to get back in position.}  22. Ng4 Bxh2+ { Not
sure if this was a good trade but I thought I should trade pieces as I had less
space. Also once this piece was gone I started to relax as I thought I'd
weathered the storm. I didn't see a checkmate for white after this.}  23. Nxh2
{ Now this knight has gone from e5 to h2 and my knight on e4 is looking the
best minor piece.}  23... Rf7 { doubling the rooks. Is this good or bad? I
don't know but at least it's a plan! I think I was planning to follow up with
pushing the e and f pawns.}  24. Bxe4 { Now white takes the knight. I get
doubled e-pawns but it's hard for white to take the pawn as it's protected by
the bishop on b7. And if that pawn advances or gets traded then that b7 bishop
becomes a lot stronger.}  24... dxe4 { forced}  25. Qd1 { maybe Qh5 was a more
aggressive option. From d1 though the queen can get to the queenside.}  25...
f5 { shoring up the e pawn. I was starting to think at this stage of f4, e3
pushing back white's rooks.}  26. f4 $4 { this just loses a pawn. At first I
was wondering whether to take en-passant or not as i didn't see that the pawn
was undefended. I was only when I calculated Qcf4 that I realised that white
loses a pawn.}  ( 26. Nf1 { Would have played something like this to bring the
knight back into the game. The kingside looks solid enough now so would aim to
bring him to the c5 square via d2 and b3. Would have been a monster if it got
to there. Think I would have to play Bd5 to trade if it ever got to b3.} )
26... Qxf4 { This makes it really hard for white now as I have a protected
passed pawn. Now f4 and e3 are real threats and those moves would also open up
the bishop on b7 - g2 would come under pressure.}  27. Qb3 { Attacking the e6
pawn.}  27... Bd5 { Defending the pawn and attacking the queen. This is a good
square for the bishop and I would probably have moved it here at some stage.} 
28. Qb4 { Moving the queen out of the way. It's running out of squares. I
didn't see so at the time but I wonder if there's anything from Rc4, Qe6 and
then Ra4?}  28... Qc7 { Retreated the queen here. I needed to get it off f4 and
I thought from here it would support f4 advance and link up with my rooks.}  (
28... Rc4 29. Qa5 Qd6 30. b3 Rc8 31. Rb1 { white's pieces aren't co-ordinated
and I could start to push f4 and e3 here.}  31... f4 32. Re2 f3 33. gxf3 exf3
34. Re5 f2+ 35. Kf1 Rcf8 36. Ng4 Rf3 { looks dangerous for white now. Their
king is very exposed.}  ) 29. Nf1 { Now bringing the knight back into the game.
Has to go this circuitous route as f3 and g4 are unavailable}  29... Rcf8 { I
didn't know whether to just push f4 and e3 now. I played this to make sure that
when I played f4 it was well supported but I don't know if I could have played
it anyway.}  ( 29... f4 30. Rxe4 ( 30. R3e2 f3 31. gxf3 exf3 ) 30... Bxe4 31.
Rxe4 { not sure how I would have reacted if white tried this exchange
sacrifice. suddenly my pawns are looking a bit weak and white has a mass of
queenside pawns and a knight to come into the game.}  ) 30. a4 { white can
create a passed pawn on the queenside and that looks to be their best plan.} 
30... Bc4 { I miscalculated here. I played this move to take away the e2 square
from the rook after I play f4. However I didn't see until I had made the move
that this bishop protects the e4 square so now f4 is impossible.}  31. b3 {
attacking the bishop and driving it back. Now it can't protect the b5 pawn.} 
31... Bd5 { I didn't consider Bxf1 as an option here. The bishop is a better
piece at the moment}  32. axb5 axb5 { I was worried that I would be losing a
pawn here put I think Rb8 regains it.}  33. c4 $4 { this loses another pawn}  (
33. Qxb5 Rb8 34. Qa6 Rxb3 { and now it is white's c pawn which is a little
weak.}  ) 33... bxc4 34. bxc4 Qxc4 { I wanted to get the queens off so I
recaptured with the queen here. This is now threatening the d4 pawn.}  35. Qxc4
{ After the queen trade I was happy enough with my position. I had a target
with the d4 pawn and still had the f4, e3 advances to come.}  ( 35. Qb6 Rb7 36.
Qc5 Rc8 { If white avoided the immediate queen trade I don't think they could
have held onto the d pawn in the long term.}  ) 35... Bxc4 36. Nd2 { Now the
knight is getting back in the game but it doesn't have any good outposts that
it can get to. It can't get to e5 and the white bishop on d3 would dominate
it.}  36... Bd3 { Now f4 would win the exchange.}  37. Rc1 { Have to get the
rooks active.}  37... Rd7 { Attacking the d-pawn. I was willing to trade on of
the e-pawns for it. I thought that without this pawn white will find it very
hard to queen a pawn.}  38. Nb3 { Defending the d pawn.}  38... Rb8 { Attacking
the knight. If it moved (e.g. to c5) then I was going to take the d pawn and
let it take the e6 pawn. White can't defend it with Rb8 as the bishop guards
that square. And Rc3 doesn't look very sustainable - white's pieces would be
very tied down.}  39. Nc5 ( 39. Rc3 Rb4 { I think I could manoevre my pieces to
attack d4 here. Rook to d8 and then b8 maybe.}  ) 39... Rxd4 { Eliminating
white's central pawn.}  40. Nxe6 { Taking my e6 pawn and attacking the rook.} 
40... Rc4 { I wanted to trade down pieces as the pawn endgame would be winning
for black. After this black can't avoid the trade of one of the pairs of
rooks.}  41. Rxc4 { If white didn't take then Rb1+ would be coming}  41... Bxc4
42. Nd4 { Centralising the knight and attacking f5}  42... g6 { Defending the
f5 pawn. This pawn chain is very strong. White can't reall get to the base of
it.}  43. Kh2 { The king ends up getting boxed in here. Should have played Kf2
instead.}  ( 43. Kf2 Rb2+ 44. Kg3 ) 43... Bd3 { Protecting the bishop. After my
previous games I was worried about a knight fork.}  44. Nc6 { Attacks the rook.
Maybe the knight was better on d4.}  44... Rb1 { Now f4 is very strong as the
rook has nowhere to go.}  45. Ne5 { Attacks the bishop}  45... f4 { I win the
exchange here and still remain a pawn up}  46. Nxd3 { I don't know if this was
the right recapture. Black a still has four pawns and the knight can't hold
everything together.}  ( 46. Rxd3 exd3 47. Nxd3 g5 { I think this would have
been the better shot. My central passed pawn is gone and it may be difficult to
create another one. White's king is in front of the pawns and removing any
width from the position favours the knight.}  48. Ne5 Kg7 49. Nf3 h6 { could
white have created a fortress here?}  ) 46... fxe3 47. Nf4 { Now the postion is
lost. White's knight has to defend the pawns as it can be driven away by the
rook. Capturing the other way, white's g-pawn would have stopped the black
pawns' advances.}  47... g5 48. Ne2 Rb2 49. Nd4 e2 50. Nxe2 Rxe2 51. Kg3 {
White's king can't move and black is a rook and a pawn up.}  51... h6  0-1
