{ This was my first game in my first chess tournament - the Mulcahy Memorial
2015 in memory of Noel Mulcahy - a fine Cork chess player who died in the
Tuskar Rock plane crash in 1967. The highest rated player I had played previous
to this game was when I lost to a 1458 rated player in the league. I wasn't
expecting much out of the game - probably a draw at best. } 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5
3. e5 { Advance French variation.}  3... c5 { striking out at the d4 pawn.}  4.
c3 Nc6 { now can play this after c5. again putting more pressure on d4.}  5.
Nf3 Bd7 { Qb6 is the main alternative here but Simon Williams recommends this
move in his book on the French.}  6. Be2 { Bd3 would have been the Miller
Gambit}  6... f6 { still in book as per Simon Williams. My opponent wondered if
this was too early.}  7. O-O fxe5 8. Nxe5 { had to recapture as d4 was under
attack from two pawns. the other option is to recapture with the d pawn.}  ( 8.
dxe5 { I don't think this would be a good recapture. Really you want the knight
on e5. Here c3 is blocking the second white knight.} ) 8... Nxe5 9. dxe5 Qc7 {
now that there's no longer a d4 pawn, the main target is the e5 pawn. this can
be a really annoying pawn if black manages to secure it on e5.}  10. Re1 O-O-O
{ still in book. Black often castles queenside in the advance.}  11. Bf4 { I've
had this type of position in blitz at the club where this bishop is attacking
the queen through the e pawn. White also can put a rook on c1. It seems that my
queen is stepping into pins from all angles. I haven't been too successful in
dealing with this before.}  11... Ne7 { I was out of book here. This is a
useful square for the knight as it can go to f5. Or is further pressure on e5
is required it can go to c6 or g6.}  12. Bf1 $6 { I wasn't too sure about this
move. The idea is to protect the pawn but it's not in urgent need of this from
the rook. I would have left the bishop there and brought the knight to f3 via
d2.  Around here I didn't press the clock properly and it kept ticking down my
time rather than my opponents. He took 10 minutes for the move in question so
that was a 20 minute swing. Was really disappointed at that as I would have had
a chance of putting him under some time pressure near the end of the game.}  (
12. Nd2 { I would have played this move without any thought. Develop your last
minor piece and have the option of Nf3 to protect the e pawn.}  12... h6 { This
is the approach recommended by various books/engines. Prepares g4 on the next
move. It also prevents any Bg5 ideas.}  ) 12... g6 { the plan was to fianchetto
the bishop and attack e4. I wonder if a better approach was to play h6 and g5
and then Bg7. This would have driven back the white dark squared bishop and
left my pawns in a secure formation.}  13. Nd2 { developing the knight. Can go
to f3 if needed to protect e5.}  13... Bg7 { completing the bishop's fianchetto
and attacking e5}  14. Rc1 { optically this looks good in that it is on the
same file as my queen and king. But we were discussing after the game that this
file never got opened up and never looked like being opened up. Would have been
better to play this to the b file immediately or wait to see what was going to
happen.}  ( 14. Bg5 Rde8 15. Bf6 Bxf6 16. exf6 Nf5 { This is the computer's
recommended variation. I think black would be fine here. I'm not sure how
easily defended that pawn on f6 is.}  ) 14... Rdf8 { had to move one of my
rooks to the semi-open file. I thought the other rook could be useful in
driving the h pawn down the board. It turned out that I lost the game having
never moved that h rook. Maybe would have been better to look for an
opportunity to double my rooks on the f file.}  15. Bg3 { Needed to either
defend the bishop or move it back. Playing something like g3 would make the
exchange sacrifice really tempting. He could play Bd3 to attack my c pawn. Then
I would take the e pawn and threaten to take on h7. Defending the bishop with
Qg4 could have been an option but this would line up the queen with my light
squared bishop. Also having the queen on the g file may allow me to win tempos
against it when I start rolling my g and h pawns.}  15... h5 { Starting to push
my pawns towards the white king. The threat is h4 winning the bishop but this
can be prevented with a pawn more e.g. h3, f3 or f4. I'm not sure that this is
a good move. I'm not happy with how my pawns ended up in the game. I think it
may have been better to improve the position of my pieces. Perhaps Bc6 so that
d4 in response to c4 would be even stronger as it would open up that bishop.
Nf5 would also be good. I could probably trade that knight for his dark squared
bishop. I could also prepare to double rooks on the f file with Rf7. Looking at
how the game went I needed to have made my pieces more active.}  16. h3 { makes
an escape square for the bishop}  16... g5 $6 { I think that this was
premature. I should have made one of the piece moves listed in my previous move
here. However the computer says it's fine. I think in future games I would
prefer to leave it at h6 and g5 and then develop my pieces behind the pawns}
17. c4 { striking out on the queenside. attacks my d pawn. if I let him trade
this pawn for the d pawn then I open a very dangerous file for his rook.}
17... d4 { this is a good move. I get a protected passed pawn, lock up the
kingside and open the a8-h1 diagonal for my bishop on c6 ... oh wait ... I
played g5 instead of that. Now that g5 move looks worse.}  18. Ne4 $5 { This
move loses the e pawn but this is a great square for the knight. It attacks the
undefended g pawn so white can win that pawn back anyway. If I hadn't moved g5
then this would be a bad move I think as I would win a central pawn for not
much. My opponent after the game thought that this was a mistake but it turns
out that the computer says it's fine.}  18... Bxe5 { I have to take this pawn.
I couldn't leave it support a knight on d6. I think it's a good move as now
white has no d or e pawn.}  19. b4 $2 $155 { Feck. With the knight on e4 I
don't think I can ignore this pawn move now. I was afraid of Nxc5. After the
game my opponent said that he thought I was wasting time with b6. That move
lead to the b file opening up. Looking at it now I could have played cxb5 and
then Bc6. This bishop would blockade the c pawn. The c pawn blocks white's own
rook from attacking my king and there is not really any prospect of white
getting to trade his c pawn. White would probably eventually win that b pawn
but I wouldn't care as long as the queenside remained blockaded.  The computer
says that this move is a mistake.}  19... Bxg3 { I also thought that I should
exchange on g3 to give him doubled pawns and leave a target on g3 for my queen
to attack. I'm not sure I should have done that though. I don't think I ever
was able to take on g3}  ( 19... cxb4 { This would be an option and after Bc6
and Nf5 I would have a good attack. Or I could play Nc6 and try to hold on to
the extra two pawns. My e pawn is a bit weak though. The computer says that
this is a mistake however.}  20. Qd2 Bf4 ( 20... h4 $2 21. Bxe5 Qxe5 { My queen
is very precariously placed but there is no good discovered attacks yet by the
knight.}  22. Qxb4 Nc6 { I'm not a fan of putting the knight here but it does
leave the bishop still guarding e6. Unfortunately Nc5 is really unpleasant
now.}  ( 22... Nf5 $2 23. Nc5 Qc7 24. Nxe6 Bxe6 25. Rxe6 { maybe black's
position after cxb4 wasn't so good. e6 is really weak it seems.}  ) ) ( 20...
Bc6 $2 { this would be bad as white could crash through on e6.} ) 21. Bxf4 (
21. Qxd4 Bxg3 22. fxg3 Nc6 ) 21... gxf4 { Now e5 would consolidate my central
pawns on the opposite colour to my bishop. I think Bc6 could be played in this
line.}  ) 20. fxg3 b6 $2 ( 20... Nf5 21. Nxc5 Qxg3 22. Ne4 ( 22. Nxe6 $4 Nh4
23. Nxf8 Rxf8 24. Rc2 ) 22... Qf4 ) ( 20... Bc6 21. Nxc5 ( 21. Nxg5 Qxg3 22.
Nxe6 Rxf1+ 23. Rxf1 Qxg2# ) 21... Qxg3 22. Qe2 ) 21. bxc5 bxc5 { this is not
good as now I've opened up the b file. That proves to be crucial as his rook
will prevent my king escaping the mating net.}  22. Rb1 { seizes the open b
file. I didn't realise how little squares my king has left here. I also
overlooked Nc6+ is available if my queen moves.}  22... Nf5 $2 { Bringing my
knight into the attack. It wasn't doing much on e7. It attacks the g3 pawn and
defends the d6 square. Other options were Bc6 but that would leave e6
undefended. Computer says that this is a mistake and that I should have played
g4 instead. I don't think I'd ever have seen that move. I assumed that I should
make my knight more active.}  23. Qd3 $2 { Protects the g3 pawn. I had thought
that Qb3 was a better move and the computer agrees. It does pretty much the
same thing that d3 does but has the benefit of threatening down the open
b-file.}  ( 23. Qb3 Ne3 24. Nxc5 Rxf1+ 25. Rxf1 Nxf1 26. Kxf1 Rf8+ { White is
better here. Better piece co-ordination - has two pieces on the b file. Also
his king is more secure. I do have two passed central pawns though. My plan
would have to be to try to get them moving.}  ) 23... g4 { talking after the
game, my opponent thought that this was the wrong pawn to push. Pushing the h
pawn would weaken the dark squares around the white king. Pushing the g pawn
allows him to lock things up by pushing the h pawn.  However Stockfish says
that this move is fine and one of the best moves in the position.}  ( 23... h4
24. g4 ( 24. gxh4 g4 25. hxg4 Rxh4 ) 24... Ne3 ) 24. h4 Ne3 { The knight looks
really good on e3. From here I traded it for the bishop on f1. Not sure now why
I did that.}  ( 24... Kd8 { This is the move that the computer recommends. I
didn't consider this at all as I didn't see that my king was in so much danger.
I takes the king out of the way of Nd6.} ) 25. Rb2 { Preparing to double or
possibly even triple on the b file  (  This was also a good reason to have
played Qb3 earlier  )  . I think that his attack down the b file would be
really strong, possibly unstoppable.}  ( 25. Rxe3 { The computer recommends
this exchange sacrifice instead. I don't think there was any chance of my
opponent playing it though. At club level it's asking a lot do trade a rook for
a knight like this when there are other plausible moves.}  25... dxe3 26. Qxe3
Rf5 ) 25... Rxf1+ { I wanted to trade down to a more manageable endgame. I
though that if I could remove at least one of the rooks then the chances of
getting mated would be reduced.}  ( 25... Kd8 { I had another chance to play
this move thanks to white's previous move. Again never even considered it.} )
26. Rxf1 Nxf1 27. Qxf1 { From here I think it should be holdable. However I
didn't realise how much in danger my king was in.}  27... e5 { As soon as I
played this I saw Qf6. My intentions in playing the move were to solidify the
central pawns and release my bishop. Unfortunately it opens the 6th rank his
heavy pieces. After Qf6 he is able to play Nd6 check and I can't take the
knight. Same as my first league game I play an instantly losing move. What a
moron. I was really disappointed as I was going fine up to here.}  ( 27... Qe5
{ I think this would hold it together. I still need to get the rook into play
and I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe Bc6 is a move here and then rook
somewhere. Computer says that white's best move is to trade queen's on f4. If
that happened I'd be quite happy with my position with pawns on both sides of
the board and a bishop vs knight.} ) 28. Qf6 { A killer move. Attacks the rook
and threatens Nd6+. I can't protect against both.}  28... Qd8 ( 28... Qc6 29.
Qxh8+ ) ( 28... Re8 29. Nd6+ Qxd6 30. Qxd6 ) 29. Qa6+ Kc7 30. Qxa7+ Kc6 31.
Qxc5# { I was disappointed to lose the game in the end. I played well in the
opening but lost my way in the middlegame. It was my first game in the
tournament and I wasn't sure what to expect. My previous league games had me
losing to a 1450 and beating an 1100 so I thought that I was somewhere in that
range. This game showed me I could almost compete at the 1500 level. Taking the
positives from it I was still well in it after 25 or so moves. The other thing
to take away from the game is to always make sure that my clock is pressed. For
the other games in the tournament, I wrote down my time after each move and
made sure that the clock was correct as I was writing it down.}   1-0
