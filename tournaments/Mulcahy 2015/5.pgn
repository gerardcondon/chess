1. e4 d5 { The Scandinavian Defence.}  2. exd5 { I don't really know if there is
an alternative to taking the pawn here. Can't defend it with d3 and I don't
know if Qe2 is any good.}  2... Qxd5 { The pawn structures become imbalanced
now. White has a queenside majority but black has a kingside majority. Black's
queen is brought out early in this defense. The obvious move to gain time on
this is Nc3. I always fel a bit nervous against this defence as the king is on
an open file and the queen is floating around.}  3. Nc3 { I think this is a
safe enough move but I don't know if it's the best one. Sam Collins in his e4
DVD recommends not making this move and leaving the possibility open for
playing c4. I think that might be a better way to play it as I felt during the
game that my d pawn was almost like an isolated pawn. If I could get in c4 and
d4 instead I would have a much better centre.}  3... Qd6 { There are loads of
squares to move the queen e.g Qa5, Qe5, Qd8. This looks as good as any. I can't
easily attack it again with any of my pieces.}  4. d4 { Staking a claim in the
centre and freeing the c1 bishop. I think it's a logical follow up to Nc3.
Other moves to consider are Nf6 or possibly developing the bishop somewhere.} 
4... a6 { I thought this was a waste of time when my opponent made it. However
after the game I was shown moves like Nb5 and then developing the bishop to the
b8-h2 diagonal putting pressure on c7. Apparently you play this move in the
Scandinavian at some stage so may as well play it now.}  5. Be2 { I need to
develop the bishop somewhere in order to castle. I wonder should I have been
more agressive and put it on c4. At least here it stops any checks on the
e-file but I don't know how serious they would have been in any case. Also when
I develop my knight to f3 then there would be an opportunity for black to pin
it on g4.}  5... e6 { Looks a sensible move. Makes space on e7 for the bishop.}
 6. Nf3 { Completing kingside development and preparing to castle.}  6... Nf6 {
Another standard developing move.}  7. O-O { Get my king to safety. In an
opening that I don't know I typically try to castle early so that there's less
of a risk of running into tricks.}  7... Be7 { Develop the bishop and prepares
for castling.}  8. Re1 { Developing the rook, putting it on a semi open file.
At the moment it's lined up against the black king but that shoudn't last too
long.}  8... O-O { Castled removing the king from the firing line.}  9. Bg5 {
Develops the bishop. Where else could it go really? It's not doing too bad here
as the e7 bishop is only defended by the queen so it may be prone to tactics -
possibly with Nd5 ideas.}  9... Nc6 { Develops the knight and attacks the d4
pawn. The other place this knight could have gone was to d7 and this could
prepare c5.}  10. Qd2 { Developing the queen and preparing a space for the a1
rook to come to. Also protects the g5 bishop.}  10... b5 { Prepares for a
queenside fianchetto but also blocks my light squared bishop from coming to c4.
In a IQP position that diagonal would be where I would want to put that bishop
and this position has some similarities with those.}  11. a3 { Cutting out any
ideas of Nb4}  11... Bb7 { Completing the fianchetto}  12. Rad1 { Developing
the rook and protecting the queen and d4 pawn. All my pieces are nicely
developed at this stage. Not sure what else I could have done.}  12... Rfe8 {
Developing the rook and protecting the e7 bishop.}  13. Bf4 $6 { I had wondered
if I could have done anything with taking on f6 and then playing Nd4 but that
doesn't amount to anything really. I moved the bishop back to drive back
black's queen and also eye up the c7 pawn.}  ( 13. Bd3 { The computer says that
the bishop was better placed on g5 and that I should ahave improved the
position of the e2 bishop by playing Bd3.} ) 13... Qd8 { Could maybe also have
gone to d7 and then play Rd8.}  14. d5 $2 { this leads to mass simplifications.
I thought I might have been in with a chance to win a pawn but that never
materialised. In retrospect I wonder I would have been better served improving
the position of some of my pieces - e.g. the c3 knight and e2 bishop. Problem
is if my c3 knight moves then black gets d5 for a knight. Also not sure where
the e2 bishop could have gone - to d3 maybe but what then from there?}  ( 14.
Bd3 { Again this would have been a better move than what I played. The computer
says that d5 was a bad move. After the clearances black has an open position
with better placed bishops I think.} ) 14... exd5 15. Nxd5 { trading off the
knights and clearing out the centre.}  15... Nxd5 16. Qxd5 { my pieces are
still well placed I think. I certainly don't consider my postion to be worse
but I don't know what to do from here.}  16... Bf6 $2 { Attacks the b2 pawn. I
went for the queen trade but that doesn't seem to great for me. Maybe if I had
protected the b2 pawn then I could have gone after the c7 pawn. I was worried
that my queen was on the same diagonal as the b7 bishop.}  17. Qxd8 { Trading
queens. At this stage I hadn't played too many games and was happy enough
really to draw against 1500ish rated players. I thought that with the queens
off there was less danger to me. If I was playing this game now, my thoughts
may have changed on that.}  ( 17. Qh5 { This is the move the computer
recommends. I never even saw this. I just assumed that either I would take
black's queen or black would take my queen.}  17... Qc8 18. Ng5 Bxg5 19. Qxg5
-- 20. Qg3 { I win the two bishops and have a really strong attack on the c7
pawn.}  ) ( 17. c3 Qxd5 18. Rxd5 { I don't think there is a discovered attack
on the rook that I can't escape from. I could possibly bring the rook into d7
if black plays Rc8 to defend the c pawn.}  18... Rac8 ( 18... Nb4 { this is why
c3 is bad. The knight can hop to b4 and from there to d5 or c2.}  19. Rd2 Nd5
20. Bg3 Nxc3 ) 19. Rd7 { I think this is better for me than what happened in
the game but wouldn't arise as black would have diverged at Nb4.}  ) 17...
Raxd8 { I've basically helped black develop the rook.}  18. Rxd8 { Bxc7 doesn't
work due to the pawn hanging on b2. I traded a pair of rooks to minimise
tactics against me.}  18... Rxd8 $2 ( { retaking with the knight was the better
option here as the knight can go to e6 and defend the c pawn. Also the c pawn
is now free to advance. } 18... Nxd8 19. c3 Ne6 ) 19. c3 { Protecting the c3
pawn and stopping the knight going to b4 or d4.}  19... Rc8 { Protecting the c
pawn. This rook is passively placed and I think white must be better here. I
wasn't able to convert that into any material advantage.}  20. Bd3 { The bishop
was doing nothing much on e2 so I moved it to a more central position. Find
your worse piece and improve it is the advise I've heard before. There possibly
is a threat to play Ng5 now. There is definitely a back rank threat now.} 
20... g6 { Cutting out anything on h7 and giving the king some luft. Now there
is no back rank issues.}  21. Kf1 { Moving the king closer to the centre and
getting rid of back rank issues.}  21... Ne7 { Unveiling an attack on the f3
knight. Could double my pawns with Bxf3. Also this knight can come to d5 and
threaten the dark squared bishop.}  22. Be5 { This forces the dark squared
bishops off the board. Not sure if that was my best move as now the pressure on
c7 is removed. However black would probably have played something like c5 soon
anyway.}  22... Bxe5 23. Nxe5 { This knight has a good square here. It's very
central and is in enemy territory.}  23... Nc6 $6 { Offering a trade of
knights. The computer disagrees with this move and says that Rd8 was better.
There's no more threat to the c pawn and Nc6 just blocks it in I suppose.}  24.
Nd7 { I didn't want to trade the knights as I thought my knight was better.
Maybe trading the knights and Re8 was a move?}  ( 24. Nxc6 Bxc6 25. Re7 { but
then I can't maintain the rook on e7.}  25... Kf8 ) 24... Rd8 { Threatening the
knight and also the bishop behind it.}  25. Nc5 { Forced to protect the bishop.
This has the benefit of attacking his bishop and the pawn on a6.}  25... Bc8 {
Moving the bishop to safety while still defending a6.}  26. Rd1 { Protecting
the bishop even more. The king can come to the e file and the bishop can drop
back to c2 and then onto b3 maybe.  I offered a draw here. I thought I had
given it a good shot but the position was always drawish. I thought that black
had started to gain the upper hand here as the rook was becoming active and the
knight might start to go to e5 and then onto c4. From a tournament point of
view this was a good draw for me. In terms of learning though not so good. I
would have been better off playing out the endgame and even if I lost I would
have had something to stufy and improve on. As it is I have no idea what I
should do in this position and playing through it would have helped.}  ( 26. a4
{ Would something like a4 have been a move here? I might have been able to pick
up one of black's queenside pawns. If bxa4 then I would take the a4 or a6 pawn
and black would have split queenside pawns.}  26... bxa4 27. Bxa6 Bxa6+ 28.
Nxa6 Rd2 { this is very murky. I probably would have lost but at least would
have something to analyse.}  29. Nc5 Rxb2 30. Nxa4 Ra2 )  1/2-1/2
