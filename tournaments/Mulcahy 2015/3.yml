game: 3.pgn
conclusions:
    - exd4 is a legitimate response to cxd4. I just assumed that white would recapture with the c-pawn after placing their rook on c1.
    - against the London system I need to deal better with the bishop on f4. Perhaps Bd6 here instead of Be7.
    - during the game I thought I was losing badly for a good while. I remember thinking after 30 minutes that I was going to lose fairly quickly. However when I look on the computer white never had a massive advantage. Admittedly they could have gone to about 1 ahead on the computer evaluation but I think at this level I shouldn't be to afraid unless they have a material advantage. Certainly I wouldn't feel confident that I could convert a positional advantage.
    - I could be more aggressive with my pawn advances.
    - I was very happy to win this game as the tournament hadn't been going to great for me with a loss and a draw. I was happy enough with how I finished out the game once my opponent had blundered the f pawn. I did miss some opportunities to win more convincingly but I was never in danger of giving away my advantage.
errors:
    - Postional. Got a cramped position and failed to see white's attack.
    - Pawns. Didn't see all of white's recaptures on d4.
    - Tactics. Missed pin on knight against h7.
    - Pawns. Missed aggressive f4 advances.
    - Endgame. Could have centralised the king sooner in the endgame.
