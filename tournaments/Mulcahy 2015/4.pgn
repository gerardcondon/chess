1. e4 e6 { French defense.}  2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 { Nc3 variation.}  3... dxe4 { The
Rubinstein variation. The advantage of this is that it can be played against
both Nc3 and Nd2, so less prep is required.}  4. Nxe4 Be7 { This is the move
from Purdy's Action Chess book. The main line would be Nd7 here.}  5. Nf3 {
Standard move developing the kingside knight.}  5... Nf6 { Attacks the knight
on e4 and develops the kingside. I can now castle kingside if I wish.}  6. Ng3
{ Normally I see Nxf6 or Bd3. This is a lot rarer. The knight is still
developed, however it doesn't have many squares to jump to. The e6 pawn stops
it coming to f5.}  6... Nbd7 { Standard move in these postions. We want to play
c5 so Nc6 is ruled out. This does lock in the bishop but hopefully we can
develop that to b7.}  7. Bb5 { Pins the knight to the king. This would prevent
the knight responding to a Ne5 move. There is no danger to the knight though
and the pin will be removed once I castle.}  7... a6 { This puts the question
to the bishop. There is no point exchanging on d7 so it will probably drop back
somewhere. I'm not sure this was a great move to be honest. I could probably
have driven on with c5 instead.}  ( 7... c5 { seeing this on the board I
realise that Qa5+ is now a threat so white may have dropped back the bishop
anyway. Qe2 would prevent this but it blocks in the c1 bishop and in most of
these games I see the queen developed to e2 and then possibly to e4.} ) 8. Bd3
{ I think this is the best square for this bishop. It attacks  h7. If this
queen can get to e4 then it would be really dangerous.}  8... c5 { Standard
move in the Rubinstein. If white takes then he has no remaining central pawns.
Either way I have staked out some space on the queenside.}  9. O-O { Gets the
king to safety and allows the rook to come to e1.}  9... O-O { I castled here
but not sure it couldn't have waited. Maybe b5 would have been a better move -
allowing Bb7 and possibly threatening c4.}  10. c3 { Defends the pawn and
creates a square on c2 for the bishop or queen.}  10... cxd4 { After the
previous move I just assumed that white would take back with the pawn. It never
crossed my mind that he could also take back with the knight. This was
completely hope chess. I should have checked all his recaptures. In that case I
would never have taken as the knight is very dominant on d4. It severly limits
the option of playing b5.}  ( 10... b5 { This was what I should have played.
Bb7 is next. Qc7 and then develop the rooks. Looks like a grand position for
black.} ) 11. Nxd4 { This is really bad for me. It's not easy for me to shift
that knight.}  11... Nc5 { I'm no sure what the point of this move was. I think
I would have been better off trying to reroute the knight to d5 via b6. Or even
Ne5 with the idea of Qc7 and the Nc6. I vaguely remember during the game that I
calculated this move, saw that it was bad, had decided on another move but
played this anyway. Inexplicable really.}  12. Bc2 { Protects the bishop. At
this stage in the game I was feeling like I had messed up the opening. I didn't
really know what I was doing.}  12... e5 { This drives the knight away but
means that I need to protect this pawn with pieces. Also it opened up the a2-g8
diagonal for his bishop. That proved to be really serious later in the game.} 
13. Nf3 { Dropping the knight back to f3 where it attacks the e5 pawn.}  13...
Qc7 { Defends the e5 pawn and makes way for a rook to come to d8 (which didn't
happen for ages)}  14. b4 { Pushed back the knight. It was never secure on c5.}
 14... Ncd7 { Dropping the knight back and adding additional protection to the
e5 pawn.}  15. Bb2 { I'm not sure that this was the right move for this bishop.
Typical attack patterns in the Rubinstein that I've seen since are Bg5
attacking the knight followed up by putting the queen on the b1-h7 diagonal.
The knight gets pinned due to the matee threat and I would probably have to
make a pawn move like g6 and weaken my dark squares.}  15... b5 { Staking out
space and making way for Bb7.}  16. Qe2 { Developing the queen and freeing up
e1 for a rook. My knight keeps the queen out of e4. Maybe Qd3 would have been
better. White would have a strong attack then with the two knights on the
kingside.}  16... Re8 { This was intended to give extra support to e5 after
Re1. However it really weakens f7. My king is pinned to it once the bishop
moves over.}  17. Bb3 { Now white is threatening to play stuff like Ng5. I
didn't see any of this. this was really early for me in terms of long chess
games. Now I think I would have better seen the f7 weakness.}  17... Bb7 { Had
to develop this bishop really. Had considered h6 but then g6 would be really
weak.}  18. Rad1 { Develops his last piece and grabs the open file.}  18... Qc6
{ That's one way of preventing Ng5. I have won two games this season with
cheapos like this. It's not too dab a tactic to line the bishop and queen up
against the king and cause a bit of panic in your opponent!}  19. Nf5 { This is
a great square for this knight. It's kind of untouchable here as I don't want
to play g6.}  19... Bf8 { Thought that this was better than Bd8. It adds
support to g7 and keeps the rooks connected. However it does rule out Rf8 now.}
 20. N5h4 { I can see why white would want to do this. It removes the mate
threat. Howeve the knight was really strong on f5. I would have left it there
and considered other ways to avoid the mate - could move the other knight to
h4. This is really where the b2 bishop is out of the game If it were on g5 then
white would have a really strong attack.}  20... h6 { I need to do this to
prevent Ng5. However this allows Ng6. I completely missed that move until it
was played.}  21. Ng6 { The pawn is pinned and cannot take the knight.}  21...
Qe4 { At this stage I thought I was in big trouble and wanted to take the
queens off. The e pawn would be looking undefendable if white gets in
Re1.

Looking at it now were there any options to keep them on. I wonder if e4
and e3 are threats now.}  ( 21... e4 22. Nd4 { That put an end to e4 ideas}  )
22. Qxe4 { Forced or he loses the g6 knight}  22... Bxe4 { Would taking with
the knight have been better I wonder as this bishop ended up back on b7
anyway.}  ( 22... Nxe4 { No as the d7 knight is handing :)} ) 23. Nxf8 { White
gains the two bishops. In this position they are really strong.}  23... Kxf8
24. Nd2 { Didn't want me to double his pawns on f3 I suppose.}  24... Bb7 {
Safe back here again}  25. f3 { This limits the movement of my f6 knight. It's
not very dangerous for white to play this as I don't have any piece left that
can attack on the dark squared diagonals.}  25... Rad8 { Developing the rook at
last. I wasn't too hopeful for my position. I thought white woud win the e-pawn
eventually. Re1 and c4 would attack it. I couldn't take c4 as then Nc4 would be
strong. And if I didn't take on c4 then c5 would give white a protected passed
pawn.

But looking at it now the positon still has a lot of play. I think I'm
way too pessimistic in playing when I'm in a slightly worse position. I was
still looking for strong moves but wasn't too hopeful. One thing I've learned
since then is that there's a lot of losing in a chess position. Even if you're
worse, it's still not easy for the opponent to convert. Assuming you make safe
moves and don't blunder away material typically you would have to make a lot of
bad positional moves to lose at this level.}  26. c4 { This is very strong. I
can't take the pawn as Nc4 is really unpleasant.}  26... Nb6 { Aiming for
counterplay with my knight. If he plays c5 then the knight can go to d5 and
can't be removed from there easily.}  27. c5 { Now white has a protected passed
pawn.}  27... Nbd5 { This is a very good square for the knight. I'm threatening
the fork on e3 and the pawn on b4.}  28. Rf2 Nxb4 29. Ba3 Nd3 30. c6+ Kg8 31.
cxb7 Nxf2 32. Kxf2 Rd7 33. Ne4 Nxe4+ 34. fxe4 Rxb7 35. Rd5 Kh7 36. Bb2 f6 37.
