1. e4 e6 { French defense.}  2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 { Nc3 variation.}  3... dxe4 { The
Rubinstein variation. The advantage of this is that it can be played against
both Nc3 and Nd2, so less prep is required.}  4. Nxe4 Be7 { This is the move
from Purdy's Action Chess book. The main line would be Nd7 here.}  5. Nf3 {
Standard move developing the kingside knight.}  5... Nf6 { Attacks the knight
on e4 and develops the kingside. I can now castle kingside if I wish.}  6. Ng3
{ Normally I see Nxf6 or Bd3. This is a lot rarer. The knight is still
developed, however it doesn't have many squares to jump to. The e6 pawn stops
it coming to f5.}  6... Nbd7 { Standard move in these positions. We want to play
c5 so Nc6 is ruled out. This does lock in the bishop but hopefully we can
develop that to b7.}  7. Bb5 { Pins the knight to the king. This would prevent
the knight responding to a Ne5 move. There is no danger to the knight though
and the pin will be removed once I castle.}  7... a6 { This puts the question
to the bishop. There is no point exchanging on d7 so it will probably drop back
somewhere. I'm not sure this was a great move to be honest. I could probably
have driven on with c5 instead.}  ( 7... c5 { seeing this on the board I
realise that Qa5+ is now a threat so white may have dropped back the bishop
anyway. Qe2 would prevent this but it blocks in the c1 bishop and in most of
these games I see the queen developed to e2 and then possibly to e4.} ) 8. Bd3
{ I think this is the best square for this bishop. It attacks h7. If this queen
can get to e4 then it would be really dangerous.}  8... c5 { Standard move in
the Rubinstein. If white takes then he has no remaining central pawns. Either
way I have staked out some space on the queenside.}  9. O-O { Gets the king to
safety and allows the rook to come to e1.}  9... O-O { I castled here but not
sure it couldn't have waited. Maybe b5 would have been a better move - allowing
Bb7 and possibly threatening c4.}  10. c3 { Defends the pawn and creates a
square on c2 for the bishop or queen.}  10... cxd4 { After the previous move I
just assumed that white would take back with the pawn. It never crossed my mind
that he could also take back with the knight. This was completely hope chess. I
should have checked all his recaptures. In that case I would never have taken
as the knight is very dominant on d4. It severely limits the option of playing
b5.}  ( 10... b5 { This was what I should have played. Bb7 is next. Qc7 and
then develop the rooks. Looks like a grand position for black.} ) 11. Nxd4 {
This is really bad for me. It's not easy for me to shift that knight.}  11...
Nc5 { I'm no sure what the point of this move was. I think I would have been
better off trying to reroute the knight to d5 via b6. Or even Ne5 with the idea
of Qc7 and the Nc6. I vaguely remember during the game that I calculated this
move, saw that it was bad, had decided on another move but played this anyway.
Inexplicable really.}  12. Bc2 { Protects the bishop. At this stage in the game
I was feeling like I had messed up the opening. I didn't really know what I was
doing.}  12... e5 $2 { This drives the knight away but means that I need to
protect this pawn with pieces. Also it opened up the a2-g8 diagonal for his
bishop. That proved to be really serious later in the game.}  ( 12... Qc7 {
Developing the queen to c7 would have been a better move.} ) 13. Nf3 { Dropping
the knight back to f3 where it attacks the e5 pawn.}  13... Qc7 { Defends the
e5 pawn and makes way for a rook to come to d8  (  which didn't happen for ages
 )}  14. b4 { Pushed back the knight. It was never secure on c5.}  14... Ncd7 {
Dropping the knight back and adding additional protection to the e5 pawn.}  15.
Bb2 { I'm not sure that this was the right move for this bishop. Typical attack
patterns in the Rubinstein that I've seen since are Bg5 attacking the knight
followed up by putting the queen on the b1-h7 diagonal. The knight gets pinned
due to the mate threat and I would probably have to make a pawn move like g6
and weaken my dark squares.}  15... b5 { Staking out space and making way for
Bb7.}  16. Qe2 { Developing the queen and freeing up e1 for a rook. My knight
keeps the queen out of e4. Maybe Qd3 would have been better. White would have a
strong attack then with the two knights on the kingside.}  16... Re8 $2 { This
was intended to give extra support to e5 after Re1. However it really weakens
f7. My king is pinned to it once the bishop moves over.}  ( 16... Nb6 17. Bb3
Be6 { computer recommends developing the knight and bishop instead.}  ) 17. Bb3
{ Now white is threatening to play stuff like Ng5. I didn't see any of this.
this was really early for me in terms of long chess games. Now I think I would
have better seen the f7 weakness.}  17... Bb7 { Had to develop this bishop
really. Had considered h6 but then g6 would be really weak.}  18. Rad1 {
Develops his last piece and grabs the open file.}  18... Qc6 { That's one way
of preventing Ng5. I have won two games this season with cheapos like this.
It's not too dab a tactic to line the bishop and queen up against the king and
cause a bit of panic in your opponent!}  19. Nf5 { This is a great square for
this knight. It's kind of untouchable here as I don't want to play g6.}  19...
Bf8 { Thought that this was better than Bd8. It adds support to g7 and keeps
the rooks connected. However it does rule out Rf8 now.}  20. N5h4 { I can see
why white would want to do this. It removes the mate threat. However the knight
was really strong on f5. I would have left it there and considered other ways
to avoid the mate - could move the other knight to h4. This is really where the
b2 bishop is out of the game If it were on g5 then white would have a really
strong attack.}  20... h6 { I need to do this to prevent Ng5. However this
allows Ng6. I completely missed that move until it was played.}  21. Ng6 { The
pawn is pinned and cannot take the knight.}  21... Qe4 $2 { At this stage I
thought I was in big trouble and wanted to take the queens off. The e pawn
would be looking indefensible if white gets in Re1. Looking at it now were
there any options to keep them on. I wonder if e4 and e3 are threats now.}  (
21... e4 22. Nd4 { That put an end to e4 ideas}  ) ( 21... Bd6 { computer
recommends saving the bishop. I don't think I even saw this in the game. I
think I got mixed up and thought that the rook could capture the bishop or
something stupid like that.} ) 22. Qxe4 { Forced or he loses the g6 knight} 
22... Bxe4 { Would taking with the knight have been better I wonder as this
bishop ended up back on b7 anyway.}  ( 22... Nxe4 { No as the d7 knight is
handing :  )} ) 23. Nxf8 { White gains the two bishops. In this position they
are really strong.}  23... Kxf8 24. Nd2 $2 { Didn't want me to double his pawns
on f3 I suppose. The computer says that this was a poor move and he should have
played c4 instead.}  24... Bb7 $2 { Safe back here again. This was a bad move
also and I should have played Bd3 followed by Nb6.}  ( 24... Bd3 25. Rfe1 Nb6 {
computer gives this as dead even.}  ) 25. f3 { This limits the movement of my
f6 knight. It's not very dangerous for white to play this as I don't have any
piece left that can attack on the dark squared diagonals.}  25... Rad8 {
Developing the rook at last. I wasn't too hopeful for my position. I thought
white woud win the e-pawn eventually. Re1 and c4 would attack it. I couldn't
take c4 as then Nc4 would be strong. And if I didn't take on c4 then c5 would
give white a protected passed pawn. But looking at it now the position still has
a lot of play. I think I'm way too pessimistic in playing when I'm in a
slightly worse position. I was still looking for strong moves but wasn't too
hopeful. One thing I've learned since then is that there's a lot of losing in a
chess position. Even if you're worse, it's still not easy for the opponent to
convert. Assuming you make safe moves and don't blunder away material typically
you would have to make a lot of bad positional moves to lose at this level.} 
26. c4 { This is very strong. I can't take the pawn as Nc4 is really
unpleasant.}  26... Nb6 { Aiming for counterplay with my knight. If he plays c5
then the knight can go to d5 and can't be removed from there easily.}  27. c5 {
Now white has a protected passed pawn. However this was premature as now my
knight can come to d5. I think maybe taking the b5 pawn was the better move.} 
27... Nbd5 { This is a very good square for the knight. I'm threatening the
fork on e3 and the pawn on b4.}  28. Rf2 $2 { this protects the rook but at the
cost of the b pawn. Also white's pieces are starting to become uncoordinated
now.}  ( 28. Bxd5 { taking with the bishop doesn't help white as I can replace
that knight with another.}  28... Nxd5 ) ( 28. Ne4 Ne3 29. Nxf6 gxf6 30. Rxd8
Rxd8 31. Rf2 Bd5 { and white has a dangerous passed pawn and the two bishops.} 
) 28... Nxb4 { Now I thought I had the position well under control and that I
might have some winning chances. The c pawn is no longer passed and I think I
can win it soon enough.}  29. Ba3 { This is a good move. It puts the bishop on
the same diagonal as the king. Unfortunately I didn't seen this ath the time.} 
29... Nd3 { I completely missed that white has a discovered check. I should
have protected the knight with a5. Or maybe Rd4 was possible.}  ( 29... a5 30.
Bxb4 axb4 { After Rc8 and Nd7 white will have to play well to defend his c
pawn.}  ) 30. c6+ { My heart sank when I saw this move. I had completely missed
it. Now I would have to struggle to get a draw again.}  30... Kg8 31. cxb7 {
Now I lose two pieces for a rook. My next plan was to capture the b pawn and
quickly.}  31... Nxf2 32. Kxf2 { This is a really interesting position.
Material count is even but imbalanced. I have more pawns but he has more
pieces.}  32... Rd7 { And white can't hold on to the b pawn.}  33. Ne4 $2 {
Moves the knight to e4. I can't let this knight survive and hop further into my
position - c5 and d6 squares would be very weak. The computer says that this
was a bad move - possibly the one that gave away the win. Instead white should
have played a piece sacrifice with Nc4. Black doesn't get to take the knight
off with check and white's bishops can control the queening square. Really
can't blame him for not seeing that in the game. I'd never have come up with
it.}  ( 33. Nc4 bxc4 34. Rxd7 Nxd7 35. Bxc4 { and black can't defend against
Bd6.}  ) 33... Nxe4+ { I had to take this knight. As this is with check, I can
take on b7 with the next move.}  34. fxe4 { Once this move had been made I
wondered if white has any ideas with Rf1. Then there might be ideas of a
windmill on f7.}  34... Rxb7 $2 { Taking the white pawn. I wasn't sure what to
do now in this situation. I wasn't sure if I was winning or losing. My plan was
to shore up the kingside pawns. I thought if I could put them all on one colour
then that would reduce the effectiveness of one of his bishops. I have no idea
if that was a good plan or not.}  ( { taking on b7 first was a mistake
according to the computer. I needed to remove a pair of rooks and then round up
the b7 pawn. This is interesting. Looking at it on the computer he has a lot
more attacking potential with the rook and bishops. But getting rid of a pair
of rooks reduces that somewhat. } 34... Rxd1 35. Bxd1 Rb8 ) 35. Rd5 { This is a
good square for the rook but I think it might be a better square for the
bishop. His bishops cover a lot of squares and would be able to greatly
restrict my rooks.}  35... Kh7 { Getting the king off the same diagonal as the
bishop.}  36. Bb2 { Attacking my e5 pawn.}  36... f6 { protecting the e pawn.
My kingside pawns are fairly secure now and g6 is a good square for my king.} 
37. Kf3 { Centralising his king. A good move in the endgame.}  37... Kg6 $2 {
My king should be safe enough here. It also can be used to blunt any pawn
advances by white.}  ( 37... a5 { the computer says I needed to get a4 in
quickly and get the pawns moving down the board before white can stop them with
Bc3. My king was as safe on h7 as on g6.} ) 38. Kg4 { Taking the opposition as
such. Now my king can't advance. Still his king can't make any further inroads
into my position.}  38... a5 { I think my next move planned was a4. I offered a
draw at this position and my opponent accepted. Neither of us had any idea who
was better!}   1/2-1/2
