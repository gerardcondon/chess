1. e4 c5 2. c3 { c3 Sicilian. My standard move against the Sicilian. I play this
for a similar reason I play the Scotch and French - choose the opening from the
earliest move I can.}  2... e6 { Didn't expect this move. Was expecting Nf6 or
d5.}  3. d4 { The main point of c3 is to plant a pawn on d4. Now if black
takes, I take back with the c pawn.}  3... cxd4 4. cxd4 d5 { This is probably
transposing back into a line from the 2. .. d5 variation.}  5. exd5 Qxd5 { not
too sure about this line as the queen is exposed}  ( 5... exd5 { had wondered
if he would go for this.} ) 6. Nc3 { Standard developing move. It attacks the
queen and blocks the checks on the a5-e1 diagonal.}  6... Bb4 { this move
develops his dark-squared bishop. It also pins the knight thus protecting the
queen.}  7. Nf3 { defending the pawn in antipation of Nc6. was wondering if any
Qa4+ stuff worked here but Nc6 would stop anythinbg like that}  ( 7. Qa4+ Nc6
8. Bb5 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 Qxg2 { This would be bad for me}  ) 7... Nf6 ( 7... Qe4+ {
Looked at this due to Heisman's checks, capture, threats but Be2 would be fine
here}  8. Be2 ) 8. a3 { Wanted to clarify the situation on the queenside. Think
after this the bishop for knight trade is forced which I was happy about. I
think the dark squared bishop would have been a good defender on the kingside.}
 8... Bxc3+ { I've started to read Chernev's Logical Chess - Move by Move and
the first few games involve the winning side creating weaknesses in front of
the opposing king and putting pieces on the holes created by pawn moves. I was
hoping to do something similar after this trade. My intention was to force
something like g6 and then the dark squared bishop would have been really
strong. If the game hadn't ended like it did then this plan would have been
fairly likely to come up. Probably the first decent bit of strategic chess
thinking I've ever done in a long game!}  ( 8... Ba5 9. b4 Qc6 ( 9... Qd8 10.
bxa5 ) 10. Bb5 ) 9. bxc3 { I've seen c and d pawns described as hanging pawns.
Not sure if these are as one is protecting the other.}  9... O-O 10. Be2 { I
wanted to get castled as soon as possible. I was aware that once the light
squard bishop moves then the f3 knight can't move due to g2 pawn until I
castled. I was afraid that if I moved the bishop to d3  (  where I wanted to
put it  )  then I would be vulnerable to e5 - I wouldn't want to take dxe5 as
then my queenside pawns would be isolated. Be2 was safer as the bishop is in no
danger. Not sure if I was completely imagining things though.}  10... Ne4 $2 {
I don't like this move at all. There was no need for it. I think he should have
developed one of his minor pieces - Nc3 is the obvious move for me. Also this
knight is getting dragged away from the kingside. The f6 knight is normally a
really strong defensive piece. I don't know why you would mess with that.}  11.
Qd3 { Defends the c pawn and develops the queen to a good square. Other options
here were Qc2. That may have been better as it would have allowed me put the
bishop on d3 and threaten h7. c4 is another option but it allows Qa5 which then
will trade everything off on d2. At this stage I was thinking that I was going
to get those pawns moving with c4 and d5 at some stage and blast the position
open for the bishops but that never happened. Instead his knight came to c4 and
stopped that.}  ( 11. Qc2 Nc6 12. O-O -- 13. Bd3 ) 11... Nc6 { Should have
happened last move. My pawns on a3, c3 and d4 restrict this knight a great deal
though.}  12. O-O { Got my king to safety.}  12... Nd6 { I didn't see this move
coming at all. This is the third move for this knight. I think he would have
been better off developing the bishop.}  13. Re1 { Was debating whether to
develop this rook or the dark squared bishop. A rook definitely belongs on the
semi-open e-file but I wasn't sure where to put the bishop.}  13... b5 { Again
didn't expect this move. I think it's a weakness of mine at this stage that
these queenside pawn moves are completely mysterious to me. I don't know when
to make them or whether they are any good. Now that it was made I was looking
to see if I could take the pawn. I'm attacking it twice and it's defended
twice. If I could get the knight to move then I could have won it. I forgot
that the knight could go to c4 and block it.}  14. Bf4 { I wanted to develop
this piece and thought that this was the best square for it. Other options were
to develop it to b2. I had thought that if I could get c4 and d5 in then I
would have played b2. There is a threat here in that if I'm allowed take this
knight then I can win the b pawn.}  ( 14. a4 { This was the other move that I
considered. I tried to evaluate it but wasn't sure if it was good for me or
not. I was worried that black could activate his pieces on the queenside and
that clearing out the pawns here would allow the bishop to develop to a6 and
the rook to b8 or c8. After my first game in this championship where I lost to
knight forks, I was getting paranoid about the knights here and had visions of
them jumping into the white position.}  14... bxa4 ( 14... a6 15. axb5 ( 15.
Ba3 { This move was what I was hoping for but I think black has enough ways to
avoid it.} ) 15... Nxb5 ) 15. Rxa4 { black has a passed a pawn but white should
be able to create a central passed pawn}  ) 14... Nc4 { moving the knight away
from the kingside. This was important as it removes one of the defenses to Ng5.
Looking at where this knight moves it can go to b2 to attack the queen but I
can reply with Qxb5.}  15. Ng5 { I was hoping to induce a pawn move in front of
the king. My dark squared bishop would be really strong in those situations.
When evaluating this I thought that black would have responded with Qf5 but I
don't know if white would have much of an advantage after that. I spent a lot
of time on this move. I saw that I had lots of pieces on the kingside where
black really only has the queen. Based on Stenitz's principles I thought that I
had the advantage here and so I had to attack before black could get his act
together and I would lose the initiative.}  15... h6 $4 { wasn't expecting to
get this gift}  ( 15... g6 { after the game we thought this was the best pawn
move try for black}  16. Bf3 { I think this is a good follow up to Ng5 in most
of the lines. The knight on c6 is a bit wobbly and the queen will need to move
while still defending it. In a lot of these lines we managed to overload the
queen and win material.}  16... Qd7 17. Ne4 { threatening Nf6+ so the queen has
to move. The knight has lots of good squares - c5 is another one. Black is
really weak on the dark squares. Bh6 is also threatened.}  17... Qd8 18. Bh6 {
if black leaves the rook here then I pick up the exchange. if black moves the
rook then I can play Bg5 and black now doesn't have f6.}  18... Re8 19. Bg5 Qc7
20. Nf6+ { this also picks up the exchange.}  ) ( 15... f5 { this move weakens
the e pawn}  16. Bf3 { the black queen is a bit short of squares and it needs
to guard both the knight and the e6 pawn. I don't think the e6 pawn is
defendable in these lines.}  16... Qd7 17. Nxe6 -- 18. Nc5 { the position is
opening up and the bishops look really strong}  ) ( 15... Qf5 { I think this is
the best move for black and was the one I spent time analyzing during the game.
My opponent didn't seem too impressed with it after the game as it leaves his
pawns in bits.}  16. Qxf5 { there must be something better than this capture. I
think I have to try to keep the queens on here.}  16... exf5 17. Bf3 ( 17. Bxc4
{ not sure if I'd go for this capture or not}  17... bxc4 ) 17... Bb7 { I
wouldn't have been too happy in this situation. Black's knights guard a lot of
entry squares for my rooks and bishops.}  ) 16. Qh7#  1-0
