1. e4 e6 { French Defence}  2. Nf3 { I wasn't too sure what to do about this
move.}  2... d5 { I just continued on with a normal French move.}  3. Nc3 {
This move protects his e pawn and attacks the pawn on d5.}  3... dxe4 { I
decided to take the pawn and hopefully end up in some Rubinstein variation.} 
4. Nxe4 { What else?}  4... Be7 { I'm not too sure about this move now after
the game. If this bishop is required to take on c5 then I've lost a tempo. If I
was to play this game again, I would play this with Nd7. That's a more flexible
move as the knight always goes there in the Rubinstein whereas the bishop can
come to e7 or straight to c5.}  5. d4 { Now we're back in the Rubinstein.} 
5... Nf6 { Standard developing move.}  6. Bd3 { Normal move in these lines.
This bishop can be quite powerful when combined with the queen.}  6... Nxe4 {
Took the knight. It's a line I suppose. Might want to have played Nd7 first.} 
7. Bxe4 { Forced.}  7... Nd7 { Now I play Nd7. This knight is heading for f6.} 
8. c3 { This protects the c pawn and allows the queen to come out on the
diagonal if needed. Also blocks any checks from Qa5. This check can be useful
to recapture on c5 after dxc5.}  8... c5 { This is a standard advance in the
Frebch. You have to challenge White's central pawns.}  9. O-O { Sensible move.}
 9... Nf6 { [%clk 1:28:00] Threatens the bishop. You have to knock it off that
diagonal to have any chance of developing the queenside.}  10. Bc2 { Now I see
why c3 was such a handy move earlier. Without that the bishop would have had to
go to d3 and then it would be two additional moves for the queen to set up the
b1-h7 battery. Now the queen can just come to d3. Be7 was a waste of a move as
it gave him the tempo to make this move.}  10... O-O { [%clk 1:27:00] May have
been a touch too early. I never got my queenside developed during the game so
maybe Bd7 was better here.}  ( 10... b6 11. Bg5 Bb7 12. Qd3 g6 13. Ba4+ Nd7 14.
dxc5 ) ( 10... Bd7 11. Bg5 Bc6 12. Qd3 g6 { am I losing a pawn here to dxc5?} 
) 11. Bg5 { The pin was annoying but I think I paid too much attention to it.
I've seen in notes on the Rubinstein to ignore this pin and that Bxf6, gxf6
isn't that bad for black. You can play f5 and the dark squared bishop can come
around. It can be hard for white to get pieces over to attack. Also Kh8 allows
Rg8 and you have an open file against White's kingside.}  11... cxd4 { [%clk
1:22:00] I took here as I was afraid of my bishop getting dragged over to c5
and allowing Bxf6. I think I should have allowed that and tried to develop my
queenside. Could I get away with b6? Or should I have played Bd7. h6 was also
an option as after Qd3, g6 the bishop wouldn't have been able to go to h6.}  (
11... Bd7 12. Qd3 g6 13. Ne5 ) ( 11... h6 12. Bh4 Nd5 { This looks a lot better
than the game continuation}  ) 12. Nxd4 { All I've done is to bring his knight
to a more advanced square.}  12... Nd5 { I've seen this type of move as part of
my black QGD repertoire against d4. I wanted to try to exchange bishops but I
think this move is only good if you play h6 first clarifying what white wants
to do with the bishop.}  13. Qd3 { Threatens mate on h7, develops the queen and
provides a square for the rook on d1. And it forces a weakness in my pawn
structure. Not a bad move.}  13... g6 { [%clk 1:21:00] Now the bishop can come
to h6. And there are lots of dark square weaknesses forming around my king.} 
14. Bh6 { Forces the rook to move. It is very hard to shift this bishop and it
supports various mating threats.}  14... Re8 { [%clk 1:19:00] Has to go
somewhere.}  15. Rad1 { His rook is now opposing my queen. All his pieces are
developed.}  15... Bg5 { [%clk 1:14:00] I wanted to get rid of the White
bishop. Thought if I could reduce the amount of stackers I would have a better
chance. Probably should have played Bd7 here. I needed to get my queenside
out.}  16. Bxg5 { Forced.}  16... Qxg5 { [%clk 1:14:00] Forced.}  17. Nf3 { Now
the knight wins time on the queen. Maybe trading bishops via f8 may have been
better if that's what I wanted to do.}  17... Qe7 { [%clk 1:09:00] My queen is
doing ok on this square. It guards a lot of the entry squares and I still have
hope of Bd7.}  18. Ba4 { Job done on this diagonal so off to a new one to
attack the rook.}  18... Rf8 { [%clk 1:06:00] Bd7 doesn't work due to c4
winning the knight. The rook can't go to d8 as c4 again wins the knight.}  19.
Rfe1 { Developing his last piece. Now the knight is hanging as the e pawn is
pinned against the queen.}  19... Nf6 { [%clk 1:04:00] Protecting the knight.
If I was going to move it then there was no point going to the queenside. Other
option would have been to move the queen but where would it go?}  20. Ne5 {
Black has a lot of control of d7 now. Also this move makes b6, Bb7 harder due
to Nc6. The knight can't really be shifted from here and it opens up paths to
the kingside for his queen and rooks.}  20... a6 { [%clk 0:53:00] Trying to
develop the queenside. Now b5 would come with an attack on the bishop on a4.} 
21. Qf3 { Pins b7 and attacked the knight in f6. I wasn't seeing a lot of
White's moves. Although that could be because he has loads of good options.
Still I was unable to create mini plans and stick with them as I was constantly
reacting to his threats.}  21... Kg7 { [%clk 0:42:00] The King is a fighting
piece! Steinitz would have been proud. The queen is limited to e7 or d8 to
defend the knight. The text move defends the knight freeing up the queen. In
retrospect I wonder if Rd8 was the move to play here. White could trade rooks -
I'm not sure who that would benefit. He would lose an attacker but I would be
giving up one of my kingside defenders. If he doesn't trade then maybe Bd7
becomes more likely.}  ( 21... Rd8) 22. Bb3 { This move lines the bishop up
against e6 and f7. If I'm not careful there may be ideas like Nxf7. By making
this move now I don't get to play b5 with tempo at some stage.}  22... Qc7 {
[%clk 0:38:00] I don't have a great deal of options here. I thought that if I
was to have any chance of getting my queenside pieces out that I needed to have
the queen here to prevent Nc6 ideas. An immediate Bd7 drops the b pawn.}  23.
Rd4 { I was worried when I saw this move. He can swing this rook along the 4th
rank and there's not much I can do to stop him.}  23... Nd7 { [%clk 0:26:00] I
considered b5 here. If he takes the rook then I win the queen at the cost of
both my rooks. I would be losing material but it would imbalance the game. In
retrospect what did I have to lose? Instead I played the knight away. I thought
I might be able to trade his Knight. I completely missed the mating pattern.
I'd never seen it before. I never realised that a queen and knight could be so
effective together.}  ( 23... b5 24. Qxa8 Bb7 25. Qa7 Ra8 26. Qxa8 Bxa8 ) 24.
Ng4 { Setting up the mate.}  24... e5 { [%clk 0:25:00] I completely missed the
mate threat. I needed to play something like f5 now. I thought his rook would
have to move back or to e5. This is a terrible move also in that it opens up
the diagonal to the f7 pawn.}  ( 24... f5 25. Ne3 Nf6 ) 25. Rxd7 { This came
like a bolt out of the blue. Even at first I didn't see the mate and thought he
was sacrificing the exchange. Then I saw that I couldn't take it as that would
lead to mate.}  25... Qb6 { [%clk 0:15:23] Stops the immediate threat of check
on f6. Even if there was a defence, now I'm down a piece.}  ( 25... Qxd7 26.
Qf6+ Kg8 27. Nh6# ) ( 25... Bxd7 26. Qf6+ Kg8 27. Nh6# ) ( 25... Qd8 26. Rxf7+
Rxf7 27. Qxf7+ Kh8 28. Nf6 ) 26. Rxf7+ { Forced mating sequence from here.} 
26... Rxf7 27. Qxf7+ Kh8 28. Qf8#  1-0
