1. e4 e6 { French Defence}  2. Nf3 { I wasn't too sure what to do about this
move.}  2... d5 { I just continued on with a normal French move.}  3. Nc3 {
This move protects his e pawn and attacks the pawn on d5.}  3... dxe4 { I
decided to take the pawn and hopefully end up in some Rubinstein variation.} 
4. Nxe4 { What else?}  4... Be7 { I'm not too sure about this move now after
the game. If this bishop is required to take on c5 then I've lost a tempo. If I
was to play this game again, I would play this with Nd7. That's a more flexible
move as the knight always goes there in the Rubinstein whereas the bishop can
come to e7 or straight to c5.}  5. d4 { Now we're back in the Rubinstein.} 
5... Nf6 { Standard developing move.}  6. Bd3 { Normal move in these lines.
This bishop can be quite powerful when combined with the queen.}  6... Nxe4 {
Took the knight. It's a line I suppose. Might want to have played Nd7 first.} 
7. Bxe4 { Forced.}  7... Nd7 { Now I play Nd7. This knight is heading for f6.} 
8. c3 { This protects the c pawn and allows the queen to come out on the
diagonal if needed. Also blocks any checks from Qa5. This check can be useful
to recapture on c5 after dxc5.}  8... c5 { This is a standard advance in the
Frebch. You have to challenge White's central pawns.}  9. O-O { Sensible move.}
 9... Nf6 { [%clk 1:28:00] Threatens the bishop. You have to knock it off that
diagonal to have any chance of developing the queenside.}  10. Bc2 { Now I see
why c3 was such a handy move earlier. Without that the bishop would have had to
go to d3 and then it would be two additional moves for the queen to set up the
b1-h7 battery. Now the queen can just come to d3. Be7 was a waste of a move as
it gave him the tempo to make this move.}  10... O-O { [%clk 1:27:00] May have
been a touch too early. I never got my queenside developed during the game so
maybe Bd7 was better here.}  ( 10... b6 11. Bg5 Bb7 12. Qd3 g6 13. Ba4+ Nd7 14.
dxc5 ) ( 10... Bd7 11. Bg5 Bc6 12. Qd3 g6 { am I losing a pawn here to dxc5?} 
) 11. Bg5 { The pin was annoying but I think I paid too much attention to it.
I've seen in notes on the Rubinstein to ignore this pin and that Bxf6, gxf6
isn't that bad for black. You can play f5 and the dark squared bishop can come
around. It can be hard for white to get pieces over to attack. Also Kh8 allows
Rg8 and you have an open file against White's kingside.}  11... cxd4 { [%clk
1:22:00] I took here as I was afraid of my bishop getting dragged over to c5
and allowing Bxf6. I think I should have allowed that and tried to develop my
queenside. Could I get away with b6? Or should I have played Bd7. h6 was also
an option as after Qd3, g6 the bishop wouldn't have been able to go to h6.}  (
11... Bd7 12. Qd3 g6 13. Ne5 ) ( 11... h6 12. Bh4 Nd5 { This looks a lot better
than the game continuation}  ) 12. Nxd4 { All I've done is to bring his knight
to a more advanced square.}  12... Nd5 { I've seen this type of move as part of
my black QGD repertoire against d4. I wanted to try to exchange bishops but I
think this move is only good if you play h6 first clarifying what white wants
to do with the bishop.}  13. Qd3 { Threatens mate on h7, develops the queen and
provides a square for the rook on d1. And it forces a weakness in my pawn
structure. Not a bad move.}  13... g6 { [%clk 1:21:00] Now the bishop can come
to h6. And there are lots of dark square weaknesses forming around my king.} 
14. Bh6 { Forces the rook to move. It is very hard to shift this bishop and it
supports various mating threats.}  14... Re8 { [%clk 1:19:00] Has to go
somewhere.}  15. Rad1 { His rook is now opposing my queen. All his pieces are
developed.}  15... Bg5 { [%clk 1:14:00] I wanted to get rid of the White
bishop. Thought if I could reduce the amount of stackers I would have a better
chance. Probably should have played Bd7 here. I needed to get my queenside
out.}  16. Bxg5 { Forced.}  16... Qxg5 { [%clk 1:14:00] Forced.}  17. Nf3 { Now
the knight wins time on the queen. Maybe trading bishops via f8 may have been
better if that's what I wanted to do.}  17... Qe7 { [%clk 1:09:00] My queen is
doing ok on this square. It guards a lot of the entry squares and I still have
hope of Bd7.}  18. Ba4 { Job done on this diagonal so off to a new one to
attack the rook.}  18... Rf8 { [%clk 1:06:00] Bd7 doesn't work due to c4
winning the knight. The rook can't go to d8 as c4 again wins the knight.}  19.
