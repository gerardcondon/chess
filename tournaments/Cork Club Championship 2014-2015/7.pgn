1. e4 e6 { French Defense.}  2. d4 d5 3. exd5 { Exchange variation of the
French.}  3... exd5 4. c4 { As recommended by the Exeter chess junior
repertoire. Looking for an IQP position. Also has the advantage that black is
unlikely to have seen this many times before.}  4... Bb4+ { Develops the bishop
to an aggressive square. Not sure I'd play this though. It seems to me that
this bishop is going to get traded for the c3 knight. I've seen similar
exchanges in the French Winawer and I'm not sure it's a great deal for black
long-term.

I'm out of book here.}  5. Nc3 { I didn't want to exchange bishops
on d2.}  5... Ne7 { I was expecting Nf6.}  6. a3 { [%clk 1:28:00] I didn't want
to leave the pin there. Was thinking of black playing dxc4 and Nd5 putting
pressure on the knight.}  6... Bxc3+ { Forced as I can trap the bishop if it
retreats anywhere.}  7. bxc3 { [%clk 1:29:00]}  7... O-O { Sensible move. Now
has the threat of Re1 and discovered checks on the e-file.}  8. Nf3 { [%clk
1:26:00] I spent a few minutes on this move. I had planned to go Be3 at some
stage to block the checks but the knight on e7 can then go to f5 if I play
that. I decided the best bet was to try to get castled as quick as possible.} 
8... Nbc6 { Standard square for the knight to be developed to. I was worried
about the pin with Bg4 here. My light squared bishop is commited to recapturing
on c4 so it can't really be used to remove the pin on e2.}  9. Bd3 { [%clk
1:24:00] Good square to develop the bishop to, especially with no knight on
f6.}  9... Bf5 { I was expecting Bg4 here. I wasn't sure what to do now.
Ideally I would have liked to keep this bishop but retreating it to e2 would
have given black a huge lead in development. I decided to leave the bishop
where it was and if black trades it then my queen gets developed.

Another
possible move for black would have been dxc4. Sometimes you see black taking on
c4 after the light squared bishop moves so that white loses a tempo  with the
recapture on c4.}  10. O-O { [%clk 1:22:00] Get my king to safety.}  10... Qd7
{ Develops the queen, connects the rooks and makes space for a rook to come to
d8.}  11. Bg5 { [%clk 1:18:00] Develop the dark squared bishop and attacks his
knight. I thought this would make it harder to develop a rook to d8 and if
black played f6 then I thought that would be very weakening.}  11... Rad8 {
Black developed the rook anyway.}  12. Re1 { [%clk 1:14:00] Developing the rook
and attacking the knight again. Not much of a threat as black wants to play Re8
anyway.}  12... f6 { This looks ugly and I think a stronger player than me
would have been able to exploit it more. Howver this pawn did inhibit me later
in the game as it took away sqares from my f3 knight.}  13. Bf4 { [%clk
1:11:00] I spent three minutes on this move which seems crazy. I was
calculating what was going to happen in future. I should have just played the
move sooner and worried about the future when it happened. F4 is really the
only square for the bishop. It would be doing nothing on h4, would only block
the e-file on e3 and c1 is out of the question.}  13... Rfe8 { Logical move to
protect the knight and develop the rook.}  14. Bg3 { [%clk 1:03:00] Here I kept
trying to make some tactics work. Given that my bishop attacks c7 I thought I
might be able to come out the exchanges a pawn up. I wasn't able to see a clear
outcome though. Maybe the computer can enlighten me.

I wanted to take the
bishop out of the firing line as if the black knight comes to d5 it will attack
c3 and the bishop on f5. Now I think I have stronger tactics against c7.}  ( {
If taking the bishop first } 14. Bxf5 Qxf5 { the queen recapture allows black
to regain the pawn with dxc4 at the end.}  ( 14... Nxf5 { the knight recapture
would lead to me picking up the c7 pawn.}  15. cxd5 Qxd5 16. Bxc7 Rc8 17. Bf4 )
15. Bxc7 ( 15. cxd5 { taking the d pawn first is no good as blacks knight holds
everything together and also attacks c3.}  15... Nxd5 16. Bd2 ) 15... Rc8 16.
Bg3 dxc4 ) ( { If I start with taking on d5 first } 14. cxd5 Nxd5 15. Bc4 { I
think this would be better than what I achieved in the game. This is an awkward
pin and I keep the light squared bishop and put it on a great diagonal.}  )
14... Bxd3 { I was diappointed to lose the bishop. Another thing which I didn't
see at the time is that my queen on d3 is undefended so if I take cxd4 then I
can't take the knight on c6 as I would lose my queen.}  15. Qxd3 { [%clk
1:03:00] Forced.}  15... Kh8 { Getting the king off the a2-g8 diagonal so there
is no check on c4. However this does open up the possiblity of back rank
mates.}  16. Rab1 $155 { [%clk 0:51:00] I lost the plot around here. I should
have taken on d5 and then tried to push the central pawns. Even if those pawns
got removed from the board, it would open up the position for my bishop. As it
was in the game those pawns became really weak and I was probably losing them
at the end.

I had a sizable clock advantage before this move but lost that and
my position over the next few moves.

I was thinking about trying to double my
rooks but black can always trade a pair of them off after Nf5 so I didn't think
it was worthwhile.

I was thinking that after Rb1 at least I have the rook on
an open file and that it can threaten to come to the h file via b5. I don't
have any rook lifts on the e-file so that rook is kind of stuck there.}  ( 16.
cxd5 { I think taking now on d5 is the better move. I was so focused on whether
I could win a pawn on c7 that I delayed this capture even though it would have
given me a better position.}  16... Nxd5 { if black takes with the knight then
I can drive the knight back with c4 and d5. I had visions of moving my knight
to e6 via d4.}  ( 16... Qxd5 { taking with the queen for black just loses a
pawn.}  17. Bxc7 Rc8 18. Bf4 ) 17. c4 Nde7 18. d5 ) 16... b6 { defends the
b-pawn}  17. h3 { [%clk 0:48:00] A waste of a move. I was worried about back
rank issues but I just gave black time to take the initiative with Na4 after
this. If I was moving the pawn at all I should have gone h4 and tried for an
attack on the black king.

Even now dxc4 is better than h3.}  ( 17. cxd5 Qxd5 (
17... Nxd5 18. c4 Nde7 19. d5 Na5 20. Nd4 { this sequence brings my knight to a
great square and my central pawns are stronger than what happened in the game} 
) 18. Rb5 Qd7 19. Rh5 { with a strong attack - my pieces are on the kingside
while blacks are in the centre or queenside}  ) 17... Na5 { I missed this move.
In fact I missed a lot of blacks moves after this. I still have problems
dealing with opponents' knights.}  18. cxd5 { [%clk 0:47:00] this is forced as
the pawn is dropping otherwise. However now this capture is bad for me as black
brings his pieces to agressive squares and threatens my queenside pawns.} 
18... Qxd5 { I thought he would have recaptured with the knight as d5 is a
great square for it. Also this would have held onto the c7 pawn.}  19. Bxc7 {
[%clk 0:41:00] This was very risky as it allows him to bring a rook to c8 and
now the c pawn is very weak. My thinking was that the c-pawn was weak anyway
and likely to drop so I'd better get some material for it while I can.}  19...
Rc8 { only move really. I've helped him develop his rook to a great file.}  20.
Bf4 { [%clk 0:37:00] I retreated it to f4 as I thought it might be useful in
any kingside attack or defending the queenside pawns by coming back to d2.} 
20... Nc4 { Now my position starts to become really unpleasant. His knights get
to good squares and I have no way to kick them away. This threatens the
a-pawn.}  21. a4 { [%clk 0:35:00] I didn't think I could hold on to this pawn
long term but I wanted to make it harder for him to take it.}  ( 21. Bc1 { this
would also have defended the pawn but it looks really ugly. It disconnects the
rooks and is very passive. I think if I had to play this I was in great trouble
anyway.} ) 21... Qc6 { Attacks the a4 pawn and doubles up on the c-file.
Starting to look bad for me now.}  22. Rb5 { [%clk 0:32:00] Defends the a-pawn
for the time being and threatens Rh5. I figured why not defend aggressively
rather than passively.}  22... Nd5 { I missed this move and now black has a
great position. The knights dominate the queenside and I think will gobble up
my pawns soon enough.}  23. Rxe8+ $155 { [%clk 0:24:00] I decided to trade
rooks here and afterwards I don't think that was the right decision. My
thinking was that I would free up the f3 knight to move somewhere. However I
think I just gave up the e-file for nothing. After this blacks rook on e8 was
really strong.

I also missed the fact that the f4 bishop was en-prise and
could be taken by the d5 knight. I spent ten minutes on this move and only
realised that while doing a blunder check near the end of that time.}  23...
Rxe8 24. Bg3 { Protecting the bishop. Only square for it and now it's out of
the game really.}  24... Na5 { Black offered a draw here and I was surprised. I
thought he had the better position. However time was getting low for both
players and there may have been tricks for me on the kingside. After the game
we had a look and I don't think we could find a good move for me here in this
position. The c-pawn looks like dropping. However if I could keep the queens on
then I could possibly threaten his king.}   1/2-1/2
