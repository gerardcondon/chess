game: 1.pgn
conclusions:
    - Need to watch out for knight forks. Keep king on same colour if possible - separated on a diagonal by a square means it takes three moves to attack the king.
    - Get rooks active in the endgame. Having my rook stuck behind my pawn was a disaster.
errors:
    - Tactics. Knight fork.
    - Tactics. Knight fork.
    - Endgame. Passive rook.
