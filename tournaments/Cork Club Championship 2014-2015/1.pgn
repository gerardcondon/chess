{ This is my first game in the Cork Chess League. In fact it's really my first
longer time control game ever really. Not used to the time control and wanted
to see how I managed my time. My path to dethroning Magnus Carlsen starts here!
} 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 { Standard French Defence. Earlier in the week I had
started looking into the Advance French and managed to look a bit on the
Tarrasch. Didn't have time to look at the Nc3 lines but what are the odds ...}
3. Nc3 { Aargh!}  3... Nf6 { From what I'd seen of the Winawer - namely the
Poisoned Pawn variation - I knew I wanted nothing to do with that. I knew a
little about the classical lines of the French. Any time I've played Nc3 stuff
before I've come a cropper on Kingside attacks - my pawns get wrecked, f6
allows checks on the e8-h5 diagonal. So wanted to be vigilant against that.}
4. Bg5 { Pinning the knight to the queen. White's next move is going to be e5
so I need to be sure that I can move the knight away when that happens.}  4...
Be7 { Breaking the pin on the knight. There are other variations that I know
little to nothing about - McCutcheon and Burn. Not sure if they are any better
than Be7 here.}  5. e5 { Attacking the knight and forcing it away from the
kingside. This basically prevents me from castling short as my king would be a
sitting duck without the knight on f6.}  5... Nfd7 { Have to move the knight
here. Problem is that it blocks in the c8 bishop  (  even more than it was
already blocked in!  )  . I wasn't able to get my queenside developed at all
until the endgame. I haven't had this kind of issue to this extent with the
Advance or Tarrasch variations. With the Nc3 lines l find that white's dark
squared bishop can come out sooner  (  it's blocked in the Tarrasch  )  and I'm
too busy dealing with the kingside to get developed and castled on the
queenside.}  6. h4 { I didn't expect this move and wasn't too sure what to do
here. I can win a pawn here by taking on g5 with the bishop and then the queen
but I thought the downsides were far too great. The h file would be open for
the white rook. The white knight could come into the game with temp by
attacking my queen. White's own queen can also join in the attack. Lots of
white's heavy pieces would be lining up against my kingside where I would have
no pieces to defend. Also white's pawn on e5 would make rerouting the knight to
the kingside close to impossible.}  6... a6 { My opponent didn't think that it
was correct. He thought it was too slow and that Bb5 wasn't in his plans. I
wan't concerned about the bishop move but what did worry me was the threat of
the knight coming to d6 via b5. I've been hit a few times before with this
knight maneuver after playing c5. Given that c5 is pretty much essential in the
French I was willing to make the move to prepare for it.}  ( 6... Bxg5 7. hxg5
Qxg5 { White has lots of open lines. The queen can come out on the d1-h5
diagonal. The knight can develop. The rook is on an open file and the bishop
can come to d3. Black has lost his dark squared bishop - typically his best
piece in the French and is left with a locked in series of pieces on the
queenside. This is well worth the investment of a pawn by white. Maybe this is
holdable at a higher level but at my level, certainly not.}  ) ( 6... O-O {
This is the line given by Ari Ziegler in the Chessbase Trainer Dvds. It looks
dangerous but the idea is to castle and then counterattack in the centre with
c5. I'm not sure I could play this move without knowing the full lines as white
had some serious attacks there with Qg4 and Bd3. But if I did learn them then
these lines would be fine.} ) 7. Bd3 $2 { I think this is a good move at some
stage and this square is the best square for this bishop. However I'm not sure
that this is the time to play this move. It leaves the d4 pawn undefended -
white doesn't want to have to defend this with a knight as then he would be
blocking in his queen. White's d pawn is at risk now if black plays c5. I don't
think white wants to play dxc5 as this would allow black to recapture on c5
with the d7 knight, allowing the c8 bishop to develop to d7. If, as in the
game, white ignores this, then black can undermine white's pawn centre by
taking on d4. One of the moves I was fearing in this position was Rh3 and then
maybe to f3 or g3. I thought this could combine with the queen to bear down on
f2.}  ( 7. Qg4 { This is the book move. White is threatening to take on e7 and
then take my pawn on g7.}  7... Bxg5 { This is probably forced}  8. hxg5 c5 9.
g6 f5 10. Qf4 h6 11. Nf3 { Not a great position for black but he still has
chances for counterplay on the queenside. I think this is the most practical
try for me as my moves are standard French moves Nc6, cxd4, Qb6 or Qa5.}  )
7... c5 { It's what you do in the French. Standard pawn break. Black needs to
generate counterplay and this is how to start. It attacks the d pawn and after
this move, the knight can come to c6 without blocking the pawn.}  8. f4 {
Typical move for white in the French, protecting the e pawn. This pawn can
potentially be used as a battering ram and drive on to f5 and f6.}  8... Nc6 {
Another standard French move and the logical follow up to c5. The knight is
developed to a square which attacks d4. My plan is to undermine white's pawn
centre and develop on the queenside while basically leaving the kingside to
take care of itself. I don't think d4 is defendable now and if I choose I can
swap off my c-pawn for the d-pawn}  ( { Computer suggests cxd4 which allows my
Queen to come to a5 with check. Either white gives up castling rights or his
queenside pawns get messed up. It doesn't seem that easy for white to get his
pawn back. } 8... cxd4 9. Nce2 Qa5+ 10. Kf1 Bc5 ) 9. f5 $4 { I don't think this
was correct. White's centre gets demolished now. I can take on d4 with the
knight, preserving my c-pawn. The knight will protect e6 and threaten the f5
pawn. White is losing these two pawns in the next few moves and will be left
with an isolated e-pawn that probably will have a knight blockading the square
in front of it. I think white needed to develop a piece instead. Either the
queen or the knight would have been my choice.}  ( 9. Qh5 { Developing the
queen would have been a useful move as now white could castle queenside with
his rook on the same file as my queen. [Computer says no. cxd4 is a good
response to this]}  9... Nxd4 10. O-O-O ) ( 9. Nf3 { Defends the d4 pawn but it
does block in the queen.}  9... cxd4 10. Bxe7 { White has to trade this bishop
to avoid losing it afer Qa5+ once the c3 knight moves.}  ( 10. Ne2 Qa5+ 11. Qd2
Qxd2+ 12. Kxd2 Bb4+ { White's bishop on g5 is blocked in by his pawns so would
be vulnerable to h6 if I could get the queen and bishop out of the way. This
would be one way of doing that with checks on against the white king.}  ) 10...
Qxe7 11. Ne2 Nb6 { Black can now play Bd7 and 0-0-0 to complete his
development. If white takes on d4 with a knight I would have traded a pair of
knights and reduced white's attack further. Qb4+ is also an option when white
either has to trade off queens or leave his king in an insecure position.}  ) (
{ The computer suggests this line for white. I would have been really happy to
reach this position in the opening with black. } 9. dxc5 Nxc5 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11.
Qd2 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Bd7 { Black is solid and has a bishop - useful as the
position opens up}  ) 9... Nxd4 $2 { I was really happy with this move. I've
won a pawn and it threatens the f5 pawn. White can't really defend this pawn
any more so must either do something with it or lose it. This move allows me to
recapture with knight on e6 if fxe6. This would leave white with an IQP with
knight blockading the pawn. Black is building up a strong central presence with
pawns on c5 and d5 and is poised to wipe out white's central pawns. In a lot of
these lines the computer does not recomend this capture. Instead it looks for a
dxc5 followed by Qa5+ plan. The reason is that if white plays c3 to stop the
check then black has dxc3.}  ( { Computer Line } 9... Bxg5 10. hxg5 cxd4 11.
fxe6 Ndxe5 12. exf7+ Kxf7 13. Nce2 Qxg5 ) 10. fxe6 { Forced really. Otherwise I
would have taken it with the knight. White could swap his light squared bishop
for the knight and leave me with doubled pawns but I don't think they would
have been too much of a weakness}  ( 10. f6 { White can't drive the pawn
forward as he loses it.}  10... gxf6 11. Bxf6 Nxf6 12. exf6 Bxf6 ) ( 10. Qg4 {
can't protect it with the queen}  10... Nxe5 11. Bxe7 Nxg4 12. Bxd8 Kxd8 )
10... Nxe6 $4 { The e6 knight is looking really strong now and threatens the
bishop on g5. I am giving up the d5 pawn here. I don't remember really seeing
that at the time. I knew I the e5 pawn was threatened as I think I assumed that
white would try to protect that instead of taking on d5. What do I know. the
computer says this is a terrible move and throws away the advantage. Should
have played Nxe5 instead.}  ( { I think the difference in this variation is
that white's e pawn is gone whereas Nxe6 with best play from white allowed him
to maintain that. } 10... Nxe5 11. exf7+ Nxf7 12. Bxe7 Qxe7+ 13. Nge2 O-O {
Black has a major advantage in king safety and Bg4 is a major threat.}  ) 11.
Nxd5 $2 { We discussed after the game whether it was better to take with the
bishop first and draw the queen out to e7 and then take on d5 with the knight
winning a tempo on the queen. This way black is forced to take on g5 with the
bishop. It does open up the h file for the rook which may be why white chose
this approach.}  ( { The computer disagreed with us and said that taking with
the bishop first is a 1.5 pawn difference. } 11. Bxe7 Qxe7 12. Nxd5 Qd8 {
Similar position to the game but white's rook is blocked in.}  13. Nf3 { This
is the difference. White gets the tempo to play Nf3 protecting the e5 pawn.}  )
11... Bxg5 $2 { The computer suggests that this is a blunder and that taking
with the knight is the best move. Taking with the knight does allow for the
bishop to come to e6 and drive white's knight away.}  ( 11... Nxg5 12. hxg5
Nxe5 13. Nf3 Be6 14. Nxe7 Nxd3+ 15. cxd3 Qxe7 { This is a much better position
that best play after Bxg5. I didn't even see the possibility of Nxg5 in the
game. I was so focused on having that knight blockade the e pawn. As a capture
it really should have made it on to my list of candidate moves. Also in the
French I should be more aware of opportunites to active the light squared
bishop.}  ) 12. hxg5 Nxe5 { I thought he would drop back with the bishop or
protect the knight. Then my plan was to take the g pawn with the queen. With
white's exposed king thought I would have been in good enough shape.}  13. Rxh7
$4 { There's a line between sacrificing material and blundering material. I
would argue that this move falls on the blundering side but my opponent would
probably argue the contrary. I don't think that white gets compensation for the
material that he gives away here and black can accept it, trade down more
pieces and consolidate into a winning ending. I was one move away from doing
that when I blundered but a stronger opponent would have dealt with that
better. I think the best you say is that this move is a good practical try but
can be refuted with good play.}  ( { Computer agrees that it's a bad sacrifice.
Drops the evaluation of the position by 4 pawns. It recommends developing with
Nf3. } 13. Nf3 Nxf3+ 14. Qxf3 Nd4 15. Qe4+ Be6 ) 13... Nxd3+ { This zwischenzug
wins material. The light squared bishop is removed and the queen is drawn to d3
to defend both the knight on d5 and the rook on h7. It can't do both so one
must fall.}  ( 13... Rxh7 14. Bxh7 Nd4 ( 14... g6 $4 { Traps the bishop but I
can't take it that easily. Also the dark squares around the king are very
weak.} ) 15. Be4 Bf5 { Computer gives black a strong advantage here even though
material is level due to black's strong attack. I think in a real game at my
level I'd take the material over the attack.}  ) 14. Qxd3 Rxh7 15. g6 $4 {
Great move. I didn't see this a few moves back and when he played it I spent
ages thinking what to do next. I have the choice between keeping the rook or
letting black take it in return for the d5 knight. I thought that the knight on
d5 was really dangerous and wanted to get rid of it. Also I couldn't see a path
to safety by trying to preserve the rook.}  ( 15. Qxh7 { The computer disagrees
with me and says that g6 was a terrible move. Much better to take on h7 with
the queen.}  15... Qxd5 { I would have played this kind of stuff. Computer says
its not great.}  16. Qg8+ Ke7 17. Rd1 Qxg5 { My king is in the centre but I'm
still holding things together. The knight is protecting g7 and e8. The bishop
is being protected by the rook. If I can get in b5 and Bb7 then I should be
fine. My queen is very active and should be able to check the white king at
will so possibly useful for tactics.}  18. Kf1 b5 19. Nf3 Qe3 20. Qh7 Bb7 )
15... fxg6 $2 { If I didn't take here and tried to keep the rook, I was worried
that my king was too exposed after gxf7, Kxf7. In retrospect I wonder if I
could just have moved my king to f8 in some of these lines and once the queens
had come off the board, then take on f7.}  ( 15... Rh1 { Had to decide whether
to keep the rook or win the knight. Thought his attack was too strong after
this}  16. gxf7+ Kxf7 17. O-O-O Qg5+ 18. Kb1 Qxg2 ( 18... Nf4 $2 19. Rf1 ) (
18... Bd7 $2 { Trying to develop my queenside pieces.}  19. Nb6 ) ( 18... b5 {
Aiming to develop the bishop to b7}  19. Rf1+ Kg8 { Maybe this is alright?}  )
19. Qf5+ Kg8 { Here is why I rejected the line but this is the wrong king move.
The knight is coming in. Possibly the rook to d8 in some lines.}  ( 19... Ke8 {
This is the correct king move - and now black is fine.} ) 20. Ne7+ Kh8 21. Ng6+
) ( 15... Rh5 { Can the rook go here?}  16. gxf7+ Kxf7 ( 16... Kf8 { Could I
get away with not taking the pawn in some variations? It protects from frontal
checks. The knight is pinned to the queen. White's king is really exposed to
Qa5+, Qh4+, Re5+.}  17. c4 Rxd5 18. cxd5 Nf4 19. Qe4 Qe7 20. Qxe7+ Kxe7 21.
O-O-O Kxf7 22. Nf3 Kf6 { And I think I can round up that passed pawn after Be7,
Rd8. The g pawn is loose.}  ) 17. Qf3+ { No}  ) 16. Qxg6+ Kf8 17. O-O-O $2 { I
thought he was going to take the rook immediately and I would win the knight. I
didn't see this move. I was a bit fortunate that I had the queen check. It's a
bit odd that - castlign doesn't prevent the check - if the uncastled white king
can be threatened by a queen check from d8 to h4, then the queenside castled
king is vulnerable to a check on g5.}  ( { Computer gives this move } 17. Qxh7
Qxd5 { White doesn't gain much from checking on h8 as it takes his queen out of
the game. In this line he's prevented from castling so if Rd1 then his king is
still exposed to checks from the black queen.}  18. Rd1 Qxg2 19. Ne2 b5 ) 17...
Qg5+ { Thought if I could get the queens off the board then my extra material
would count. Currently my extra rook is doing nothing on a8. Also my queen is
lined up against his rook on d1 and is vulnerable to discovered attacks against
it.}  18. Qxg5 Nxg5 19. Rf1+ Ke8 $4 { I'm a moron. This was one of the worst
moves I've ever made - it's only surpassed by the even more idiotic knight fork
later in the game. I completely missed white's next move. I did see that if I
went to g8 then I was getting mated so I assumed that the other direction was
fine. I didn't even see the danger from the knight fork. It was like I was so
concentrated on the black kingside for most of the game that I wasn't even
looking at the wider board. I only saw the two king moves and completely missed
that I could have blocked with the knight. In future how do I stop these forks?
I should check every move where the enemy knights can jump to and is that a
fork. The is especially so once the knights cross the halfway line. In a 90
minute game I should have the time to do this. I should check which pieces are
on the same colour and if they can be forked. If in an endgame against a knight
then I should keep the pieces on different colours. There are some simple
forking distances. 1 or 3 squares between the pieces if they are on the same
rook or file. 2 squares between the pieces if they are on the diagonal. The
specific instance here is worth watching out for. If a knight gets to d5  (  b5
 )  or e5  (  g5  )  then the rook on the long diagonal is vulnerable to a
fork. From d5 the uncastled king can be forked with its rook. From e5 if
castled long then the two rooks can be forked on f7. There are safe squares
near a knight e.g. right adjacent to it. I should create a diagram of these to
memorize.}  ( 19... Kg8 $4 20. Ne7+ Kh8 21. Rf8# ) ( 19... Nf7 $1 20. Nf3 g6 {
This protects the knight. There are a lot of wrong options here and white is
threatening a lot of knight forks. I think if I had survived move 19, I'd still
have come a cropper around here.}  ( 20... Be6 $2 21. Nc7 ) ( 20... b5 $2 21.
Ng5 ) ( 20... Kg8 21. Ne7+ Kf8 22. Ng6+ Ke8 ) 21. Ng5 Rg7 { And I think white's
attack has run out of steam}  ) 20. Nc7+ $3 { I can't believe it.}  20... Kd8
$2 { I was trying to trap the knight in the corner after Nxa8 but I think this
is a bad move. My king gets stuck to the back rank along with the bishop. I was
never near winning the knight and my rook ends up being kind of passive on the
third rank.}  ( 20... Kd7 { Could I have trapped the knight? I don't know why I
rejected this variation in the game. I thought maybe that my king was exposed
to checks from the knight on b6 but now I see that I can get the king to c6.
White's rook can't get to the 6th rank at the moment due to the g7 pawn.}  21.
Nxa8 Kc6 22. Rf8 Be6 { I think this would have been better than the game
continuation. My king, knight and bishop are active and my rook is poised to go
somewhere. If I haven't trapped the knight then at least I've made it hard for
it to escape.}  ) 21. Nxa8 Rh6 { I was trying to keep the knight blocked in but
looking at it now I don't think that was the best plan aft Kd8. I think I
should have concentrated on getting my bishop developed. Rh1 was better.}  22.
Rf8+ { White plays really well for the next 20 moves or so. He completely
outplayed me in this endgame. This move ensures that he has a really active
rook.}  22... Kd7 23. Nf3 { Threatening to come to e5 with check. One knight
was bad enough but two on my side of the board. I couldn't handle that!}  23...
Nxf3 24. gxf3 Rf6 { Was hoping for an exchange of rooks. White isn't that
stupid. My plan from here was to keep pawns on both sides of the board. I knew
that with a bishop vs knight that was the plan.}  25. Rg8 g6 $2 { Had to keep
this pawn}  ( 25... Rg6 { Computer gives this move and says its better by about
half a pawn. My rook has more freedom along the g file. Can threaten his king
and pawns.} ) 26. Rg7+ Kd8 27. Rg8+ Kd7 28. Rg7+ Kd8 { Was hoping white would
repeat the position for a draw.}  29. Kd2 { I was afraid that white would march
his king down the board while my pieces were stuck on the back rank.}  29...
Bd7 { Should I have been more aggressive with the positioning of this bishop.
Could it have gone to e6 or f5?}  ( 29... Be6 { Didn't see that this would also
prevent Rg8+.}  30. Nb6 { My queenside pawns are weak though}  ) 30. Ke3 b5 $2
{ I didn't know what to do with my queenside pawns. Still don't know what I
should have donw. In the game white's pawns seemed a million miles way from
anything I could threaten them with whereas mine were totally vulnerable.
Standard advice in engame manuals is to put them on the opposite colour of your
bishop but then they would be even more defenceless. Maybe could have tried for
a a4, b5, c4 setup}  ( { This is the computer variation. The bishop is really
good here, protecting a8 and also threatening the pawn on f3. } 30... Bc6 31.

to c7.}  ( 32... Bf7 { This was the better move. Now white's rook is in a spot
of bother. He can't check me on g8 so I can get my king active.} ) 33. Rg8+ Ke7

pawn. Wonder if I had gone Be8 again it would have ended in a draw. I offered
one around here but it was rejected.}  34. Nc7 Kf7 ( 34... Be6 { This would
threaten the white rook and pretty much force the exchange of minor pieces.

black's king is more centralised and if the knight moves, can go e4 and Kxf4.}
46. Nxa4 $4 { The logical consequence of Kxc4, Kb4 but I think this has thrown
away the win if it wasn't gone already. Now black takes the f pawn and the
threat of the g pawn should see him draw.}  ( 46. c4+ Kd4 47. Nxa4 { and I
think this is fairly terminal.}  ) 46... Ke4 { Was originally going to
recapture with the bishop but then realised that taking the pieces off was a
losing endgame for me. I had just been shown in a blitz game the previous week
the power of the bishop vs the knight in these situations. I could create a
passed pawn and white would have trouble getting the knight over to it. Also my
bishop is strong enough to stop at least one of his pawns from queening so he
will need to push both pawns while I only have to push a single pawn. In a race
I would be faster. I thought that one case if white pushed his pawns would be
if I sacced the bishop for a white pawn on c8 then white would need more than
10 moves to make a queen. Thought I could get my pawn to be a queen in roughly
that time. If white tries to stop me by moving the knight then he can't be
pushing pawns and there's no threat of him queening. If the knight sacrifices
itself for my pawn then my king and bishop should be able to stop the two pawns
between them.}  47. Nc5+ Kxf4 { Now it's a pawn race. Both sides minor pieces
can stop the other side's pawns from queening so this should be a draw.}  48.

you say?}  ( 48... Ke5 { Nearly any other king move would have drawn. White
can't take the pawn with the knight because as soon as he threatens the pawn

the clock here with an increment and it should have been fine. It was my first
experience with long time control and I was about an hour behind on the clock
compared to my opponent. I was worried during the game about this but looking
back I think my clock usage was fine. I think worrying about the clock made me
play a bit too fast here. I should have taken more care with the knight. My
opponent was marking the time I took at various intervals and I should probably
have done that also. Will try that for the next game.}  49... Kf4 50. Nxc2 g5
